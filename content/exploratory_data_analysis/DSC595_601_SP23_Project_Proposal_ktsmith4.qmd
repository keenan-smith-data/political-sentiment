## The Project {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

- A Data Science Project that examines the question "Does Political Speech indicate political bias?"
- The Data are pulled from top U.S. Think Tanks
- Think Tanks were chosen due to their:
  - Intellectual capacity
  - Mostly Free Article Content
  - Ideological Identity
- No Think Tanks were chosen that identify as "non-partisan", "centrist", or "independent"
- at least 100k articles

  - The data to be modeled is text data
  - The question revolves around human communication and bias

**Bias in Data**

- Attempt to have roughly equal sample sizes from left and right
- Politics is a spectrum not a binary
  - Simplification of complex ideas
