## Research Question {.smaller}

A **Data Science** Project that examines the question *"Does Political Speech indicate classical right-left political bias?"*

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

- The Corpus consists of Ideologically Identified Sources
  - Primarily U.S. Think Tanks
    - Specifically Chosen for Bias
  - Data are Scraped from the Web
  - These Data are in English
- Classical Machine Learning Techniques are used for Classification
  - Transformers (The tech behind GPT) are goals for the future

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

**Why?**

- We live in a politically charged and active time in the United States
- I like history, politics, and Natural Language
- How we communicate is meaningful and important
- The US Supreme Court uses Originalism and Textualism in their decisions

My interests are all the things you are not supposed to talk about at Thanksgiving
Transformers are the current highest form for NLP modeling but require much more computing power

## Political Ideology {.smaller}

"Ideologies have for different individuals, different degrees of appeal. A matter that depends upon the individuals needs and the degree to which these needs are being satisfied or frustrated." (Adorno et al. 1950)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- The study of political ideology is vast and complex (Feldman 2013; Feldman, 2017; Jost, 2017)
  - Construction of political parties are equally complicated and vast (Mayer, 2018; Mudge, 2018)
- This project chooses intentionally to focus on a wide corpus of data from left and right
- Clustering of the Sources used shows this is a complicated topic
  - Further work should focus on this diversity and complexity

## Natural Language Processing {.smaller}

"the application of computer science to the **analysis, synthesis, and comprehension" of written and spoken language" (Oxford Dictionary)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

- Mixing Data Science and how we use Natural Language
- NLP use linguistic tools to build *features* out of langauge
- These features are then transformed into mathematical vectors in order to model
  - Term Frequency
  - Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-idf)
  - Embeddings (not used in this project)
