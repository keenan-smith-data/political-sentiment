The massacre, which took place during the country’s civil war of 1980–1992 and killed some one thousand civilians in and around the village of El Mozote — most of them children — was carried out by the US-trained and -funded Atlacatl Battalion of the Salvadoran military. If the judge concludes that there is sufficient evidence to move ahead with the trial, fifteen retired military officers could face prison sentences. In his book Weakness and Deceit: America and El Salvador’s Dirty War, former New York Times correspondent Raymond Bonner cites the recollections of massacre survivor Rufina Amaya, whose blind husband and three daughters were slaughtered: From her hiding place in the trees, she heard the soldiers’ conversation: “Lieutenant, somebody here says he won’t kill children,” said one soldier. “Who’s the son of a bitch who said that?” the lieutenant answered. “I am going to kill him.” The day after the bloodbath began, soon-to-be Iran-Contra convict Elliott Abrams took up a post as Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs and set about denying that the massacre had ever happened. Even after the civil war ended, Abrams insisted that the Reagan administration’s legacy in the Central American nation had been one of “fabulous achievement” — this despite the loss of upward of 75,000 lives, with the vast majority of atrocities attributed to the US-backed state and allied paramilitary formations and death squads. During the current round of pretrial hearings, political scientist and El Salvador expert Terry Karl testified that US military adviser Allen Bruce Hazelwood was present in the department of Morazán, where El Mozote is located, with Atlacatl Battalion commander Domingo Monterrosa when the massacre transpired. The Salvadoran investigative journalism site El Faro — which has offered nonstop, bilingual coverage of the case, in contrast to a US press that generally can’t be bothered — quotes Karl as asserting that had Hazelwood’s presence “come to light at the time, it would have cut off United States aid.” Instead, a massive cover-up was orchestrated, and the gringos proceeded with their fabulous achieving. Granted, there’s no understating US willingness to flout its own aid certification laws. On January 28, 1982, for example — a month and a half after El Mozote — Reagan certified that El Salvador’s government was “making a concerted and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights.” This certification allowed military assistance to the country to continue and military advisers to remain stationed there. As Bonner writes in Weakness and Deceit, Reagan’s celebration of Salvadoran efforts took place precisely one day after both the Washington Post and the New York Times had run stories about the massacre; according to a tally by the archdiocese’s legal aid office, in the year preceding the certification “13,353 Salvadorans had been murdered by the Salvadoran Army, security forces, and paramilitary groups.” But, hey, there was a communist menace to be vanquished. And what do you know: some hard-right Vietnam War veterans lent a helping hand, offering mercenary services to the Atlacatl Battalion in particular, as Karl documented in her recent testimony. She also brought up — speaking of Vietnam — the battalion’s use of a smattering of napalm bombs in El Mozote. While not accounting for the bulk of the massacre’s carnage — characterized more by things like throwing small children in the air and bayoneting them as they descended and shooting elderly women in their beds — the napalm factor is still striking in connecting the bloody imperial dots. It’s even more striking given that the bombs were supplied by US partner-in-crime Israel, which long ago detected lucrative opportunities in making life hell for other human populations, not just Palestinians. The Israeli connection was confirmed in 1983 by then Salvadoran air force commander Rafael Bustillo to a visiting US congressional delegation, as the New York Times reported: “We bought it [the napalm] from Israel several years ago, and used it until 1981. If we hadn’t done that, I might not be sitting here today.” The article went on to note that “the delegation’s report appeared in The Congressional Record of May 26, 1983, shortly after the delegation’s trip, but attracted little notice.” As for the victims of El Mozote who aren’t sitting here today — and who haven’t been sitting here for nearly forty years — obstacles to justice have ranged from a postwar amnesty to pandemic-related delays to obstructive machinations by current Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele of the “New Ideas” party, who appears to be under the impression that fascism is a new idea. The judge in the case is himself effectively under assault and is facing two requests that he recuse himself. As El Faro explains: “If one of those requests succeeds, the hearings will be canceled and the process left in limbo.” A Salvadoran friend of mine, who runs a small shop at a school in San Salvador, recently told me about a cousin of his who joined the Atlacatl Battalion seven years after El Mozote, and whose commander had assured him at the end of the war that the peace accords were a farce and that they’d be back in business at any moment. My friend remarked: “The poor bastard died waiting to return to war; he always carried a hand grenade, and he saw ‘terrorists’ everywhere — even in his soup.” In many ways, indeed, the Salvadoran war never ended. And whatever ultimately happens with the El Mozote trial, it’s already an indictment of a US foreign policy that is fundamentally criminal. \n    left-wing \n  \n  \n    https://americanmind.org/salvo/big-other/ \n    2022-05-02 \n    Peachy Keenan \n    Memo \n    Big Other \n    American Mind \n    When I think about the futuristic dystopian movies of my childhood, I recall giant posters of a Dear Leader with a sinister grin on his face, posted around a gray prison city. Big Brother was watching you, always! We sang along to MTV: “I always feel like somebody’s watching me.”  We were warned. In our present dystopian moment, a new crop of sinister Big Brothers smirks at us from social media and TV, their soulless eyes narrowed, licking their lips as they contemplate how we will taste as they devour us. Recently I have been struck by the sexlessness of our Biden-era Overlords. Gender-neutrality is all the rage in the swamp, I suppose. Men, women, and everything in between have converged into a new subspecies of person with certain traits of both men and women. The Deep State Uberwench, as it were. Broad-shouldered, strong jawed, lipsticked with blown-out hair, power suited and pumped up, they are the end-product of the sausage grinder of execrable NGOs, D.C. institutes, bottomless and fetid think tanks, and toxic universities.  Debrided of a soul and a capacity for self-awareness, what is left after this is a human being disconnected from humanity. Neither male nor female, they are The State: they are Big Other.  “A shape with lion body and the head of a man,/A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun.” Big Other is the product of the ideological and physical strip-mining process that turns normal people into powerful tools of the Regime. It’s fascinating how each person who undergoes this process ends up looking, dressing, and even behaving the same way. It is a new breed of American bureaucrat. Neither fully male or fully female, they inhabit a genderless nether region (they no longer have their originals) where, thus stripped of inconvenient signifiers like “sexy” or “beautiful” or “handsome” or “mother,” they are free to wield their enormous powers more fully.  They have been untethered, unmoored from their original ties to family, self, their identity, and instead roped to the behemoth ship of state.  I am talking about Admiral Rachel Levine, the transgender woman who is Assistant Health Secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, who unaccountably insists that “all” pediatricians believe in “affirming” children’s confusion about gender. I am talking about the powerful transgender activists at Twitter who have sworn to destroy Elon Musk. I am talking about the cabal of Disney employees who are taking the biggest media company on the planet down in a spittle-inflected explosion of rainbow rage.  I am also talking about a particular brand of white liberal female who works for Big Tech and the Federal Government. Big Other includes a sorority of strong women who look like they have been on femininity-suppressing blockers for decades. The Janet Reno option. Ladies like longtime foreign policy barnacle Victoria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and the woman perhaps most responsible for the Ukraine quagmire. Ladies like Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower who accused her former employer of “pushing divisive content for profit.” Haugen, of course, worked in Facebook’s department of “Civic Integrity.” Ladies like Fauci fluffer and CDC director Rachelle Walensky. Ladies like scoldy podium marm Jen Psaki.  These women present as biologically female, and yet come across as thoroughly de-feminized.  A Global Fellow Enters The Chat And now a new queen bee of the hive mind has been crowned. The Biden Administration just created a law enforcement department within the DHS called the “Disinformation Governance Board,” and 33-year-old Nina Jankowicz is Executive Director. Jankowicz is a “global fellow at the nonpartisan Wilson Center and an author whose research has focused on disinformation as well as Russia and the treatment of women online.”  There is a new SHEriff in town, and she’s mad online. In a tweet, Jankowicz posted her official DHS portrait. In the striking photo, she wears something that looks like Hillary Clinton’s pantsuit threw up on Bill’s couch.  The portrait reminds me of a poster that might decorate the set of a dystopian movie from the 1980s, perhaps framed and hanging behind the desk of a glowering gulag matron. Power shoulders, jewel toned jacket snug over a dull plaid dress, that strong jawline, that glossy blowout, her lips pressed into a smirk, she eyes us greedily like a lion on the savanna. I am Nina, hear me roar. Ms. Jankowicz is now in the final instar in the life cycle of the Bug Person. Congratulations, Nina!  The Sound of Muzak Lucky for us, she left a chrysalis bursting with personal vlogs, confessionals, unfunny TikToks, and karaoke nights for us to enjoy. We can all observe this remarkable transformation from larva to nymph to adult. It is like watching a documentary that tells the story of how the Feminist Industrial Complex successfully metamorphosized an entire generation of young, ambitious Glee Club members.  Watch as a pretty, fresh faced Nina earnestly describes her dreams of becoming a “yoga instructor” in an early video. I’m sure this will soon be memory-holed as “disinformation” by the time this is published, so enjoy it while you still can. Her dreams of teaching Downward Facing Dog died, but she still has much to offer her viewers, like an ear-splitting Mary Poppins parody in which she belts out the dangers of “disinformation.”  Julie Andrews would like a word.  If “the worst are full of passionate intensity,” Nina is surely the worst.  And now Ms. Jankowicz, her hour come at last, rolls up her Kundalini mat, slides on her headphones, and cranks up the dial on her Karaoke microphone so she can listen to you tell your husband about the little boy down the street who went to the hospital after his Covid booster.  Maybe she reads the email you send your boomer dad explaining that actually there’s a Nazi brigade on the Ukrainian side and they’re committing war crimes and maybe the U.S. should not be giving those guys weapons.  Maybe Nina’s ice blue eyes go wide and the corner of her mouth curls in anticipation as she hears you whisper to a friend in the carpool line that you are thinking about homeschooling your six-year-old so he doesn’t have to wear his pronoun pin in class anymore.  Big Other is listening now, America. I’d tell you to be afraid of they/them, but it’s hard to fear such people. Perhaps, in the end, the push to fill the highest echelons of the United States Government and everything else with incompetents who fit a diversity checklist will be the petard on which its bloated underbelly is finally hoisted. They will tear it down by virtue of their own unintentionally hilarious goofiness. Recall Robert Conquest’s Third Law of Politics: “The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies.” In other words, hiring her could easily be the act of someone on our side, inserting a poison pill right at the top of the food chain. Perhaps we should be glad to see such clowns presuming to rule over us. The Regime may not make this mistake again! Big Other is so comical that they may actually corrode and dismantle the flimsy house of cards from which they spy on us, without any outside interference.  Therefore, have no fear! Untethered from that which makes they/them human, they and the rest of their Global Fellowship will eventually take on water, founder, and sink below the blood-dimmed tide of their own colossal hubris. \n    right-wing \n  \n  \n    https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/the-long-war-against-terrorism \n    2003-09-08 \n    James Jay Carafano \n    middle-east \n    The Long War Against Terrorism \n    Heritage Commentary \n    Two years down in the war on terror. How many more to go? We don't know. But, given the patience and determination of our enemies -- and the fact that two armed conflicts have yet to dampen their enthusiasm for attacking America -- it's safe to say we have much more work ahead of us than behind us. America's enemies have demonstrated their staying power -- they spent seven years planning the attacks on New York and Washington -- and we must demonstrate ours. We'll have to spend billions of dollars and suffer more casualties before we prevail. Asking if Americans are safer now than they were two years ago poses the wrong question. We can forget about ever being \"safe\" from terrorism again. But we can reasonably expect that terrorists won't run our lives or attack us with impunity -- and that we'll thrive even as we hound our enemies until they join the Soviets in the back pages of history books. But it will take time. Before this is over, the time we spent defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam's forces in Iraq will be to the timeline of the war on terror as the Korean war and the proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan were to the Cold War -- relatively brief flashpoints of action in a long, sustained struggle. Such a war requires our leaders to understand that our staying power, our will to win, is as important as any weapon in our arsenal. Our enemies doubt this. Saddam Hussein said before the first Gulf War that Americans wouldn't tolerate \"10,000 dead in one battle.\" Osama bin Laden said he was emboldened to direct the Sept. 11 attacks because watching support wane for the American operation in Somalia \"convinced us America is a paper tiger.\" Curiously, the public seems to understand the difficulty of the task better than our representatives in Congress. A poll taken in July by The Wall Street Journal and NBC found that 58 percent of Americans think we should stay in Iraq \"as long as necessary to complete the process, even if it takes as long as five years.\" Even after the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was bombed, a Newsweek poll found 70 percent supported maintaining current force levels in Iraq for more than a year, and more than half favored staying 10 years or more if necessary. Our history argues for patience, too. The National Security Act of 1947 created a unified defense department and the CIA, the nation's two premier Cold War weapons. But it took about a decade for these organizations to figure out how best to fight the Russian bear. The instruments used to fight the Soviets -- NATO, our nuclear arsenal and military assistance programs -- emerged during this period. The focus that brought victory over the Soviets emerged over time as well. President Truman at first shelved NSC-68, the master plan to confront the Russians. Defense budgets shrank. The American people were consumed with finding their place in the postwar economic boom. But the Korean War, with losses far exceeding anything seen in the war on terror, brought the Cold War to Main Street. President Eisenhower took office with a clear mandate and a new strategy to build a strong economy, preserve our open society and organize defenses for the long term. President Bush sees himself in the Eisenhower mode. He wants to lay the groundwork to win the long war against terrorism. It won't be easy. The Department of Homeland Security, which combined 22 federal agencies, will need several years to become truly effective. Still, President Bush needs to continue to remind Americans of his plans for homeland security. He needs to rein in spending on new security initiatives. Funding for homeland security has more than doubled since the 9/11 attacks. To add more funds before these are absorbed and committed wisely would be wasteful and counterproductive. The Department of Homeland Security needs to get organized and develop a national response plan as well as strategies for information technology, intelligence sharing and personnel needs. Congress needs to supply funding for emergency responders, intelligence reforms and chemical infrastructure security. State and local governments need to develop regional cooperation plans, share information and methods, and work with the Department of Homeland Security to develop a true national emergency response system. Vast vulnerabilities remain. Two years after 9/11, we need to re-affirm our national commitment to defeating the long-term threat of global terrorism.
