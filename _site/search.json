We currently live in an information rich and ideological polarized state specifically in the U.S. This project is to determined whether intellectual political speech can be accurately modeled to determine political bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will be building a data science solution that encompasses a large corpus of political speech web scraped from top think tanks with clear ideological leanings. This project will encapsulate the entire data science spectrum from data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, data modeling, and model deployment.\nData has already been collected from 4 sources and preliminary data modeling has occured. The lessons learned from that initial analysis will be pulled through into this project.\n\nAdditional data will be acquired through similar means as the first 4 data sources.\n\nThe end product will most likely be a series of deployed models with some sort of either shiny application or Power BI dashboard to provide ease of understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are on this project:\n\nStudent:\n\nKeenan Smith\n\nAdvisor:\n\nDr. Brandon McConnell\n\nFaculty Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative objectives\n\nAt least 4 deploy-able models using the Vetiver library that have been trained and optimized using grid search to find the highest accuracy model\nThe modeling and code must be left in a state where it is able to be redeployed with an expanded corpus\nThe hooks must be left so that there is potential for a generative model in the future\n\nWhat is a quantifiable metric (e.g. reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity)\n\nAt least one model with a classification accuracy of 70% or more (This is subject to change as modeling is performed)\n\nWhat is the baseline (current) value of the metric?\n\nThe current baseline for this project is the null hypothesis that political speech does not indicate bias\n\nHow will we measure the metric? (e.g. A/B test on a specified subset for a specified period; or comparison of performance after implementation to baseline)\n\nThe metric will be measured by observing an accuracy score above 70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a loose definition of the current plan\nBusiness Understanding\n\nDefining Objectives which is encapsulated in this project charter\nIdentifying Data Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nThe data will be provided via webscraping using the rvest package in R\nThe list of think tanks is currently being finalized at this current edition of the project charter\n\n\nWhat tools and data storage/analytics resources will be used in the solution e.g.,\n\nCurrently the data will be stored as CSV or .rda compressed data files\nSQLite will be explored as a way to store the data for deployment\n\nHow will the models be operationalized?\n\nThe models will be deployed using the vetiver library and possibly expanded to an API using the plumber library\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will we keep in touch? Weekly meetings?\nWho are the contact persons on both sides?"
