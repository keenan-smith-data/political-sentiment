The massacre, which took place during the country’s civil war of 1980–1992 and killed some one thousand civilians in and around the village of El Mozote — most of them children — was carried out by the US-trained and -funded Atlacatl Battalion of the Salvadoran military. If the judge concludes that there is sufficient evidence to move ahead with the trial, fifteen retired military officers could face prison sentences. In his book Weakness and Deceit: America and El Salvador’s Dirty War, former New York Times correspondent Raymond Bonner cites the recollections of massacre survivor Rufina Amaya, whose blind husband and three daughters were slaughtered: From her hiding place in the trees, she heard the soldiers’ conversation: “Lieutenant, somebody here says he won’t kill children,” said one soldier. “Who’s the son of a bitch who said that?” the lieutenant answered. “I am going to kill him.” The day after the bloodbath began, soon-to-be Iran-Contra convict Elliott Abrams took up a post as Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs and set about denying that the massacre had ever happened. Even after the civil war ended, Abrams insisted that the Reagan administration’s legacy in the Central American nation had been one of “fabulous achievement” — this despite the loss of upward of 75,000 lives, with the vast majority of atrocities attributed to the US-backed state and allied paramilitary formations and death squads. During the current round of pretrial hearings, political scientist and El Salvador expert Terry Karl testified that US military adviser Allen Bruce Hazelwood was present in the department of Morazán, where El Mozote is located, with Atlacatl Battalion commander Domingo Monterrosa when the massacre transpired. The Salvadoran investigative journalism site El Faro — which has offered nonstop, bilingual coverage of the case, in contrast to a US press that generally can’t be bothered — quotes Karl as asserting that had Hazelwood’s presence “come to light at the time, it would have cut off United States aid.” Instead, a massive cover-up was orchestrated, and the gringos proceeded with their fabulous achieving. Granted, there’s no understating US willingness to flout its own aid certification laws. On January 28, 1982, for example — a month and a half after El Mozote — Reagan certified that El Salvador’s government was “making a concerted and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights.” This certification allowed military assistance to the country to continue and military advisers to remain stationed there. As Bonner writes in Weakness and Deceit, Reagan’s celebration of Salvadoran efforts took place precisely one day after both the Washington Post and the New York Times had run stories about the massacre; according to a tally by the archdiocese’s legal aid office, in the year preceding the certification “13,353 Salvadorans had been murdered by the Salvadoran Army, security forces, and paramilitary groups.” But, hey, there was a communist menace to be vanquished. And what do you know: some hard-right Vietnam War veterans lent a helping hand, offering mercenary services to the Atlacatl Battalion in particular, as Karl documented in her recent testimony. She also brought up — speaking of Vietnam — the battalion’s use of a smattering of napalm bombs in El Mozote. While not accounting for the bulk of the massacre’s carnage — characterized more by things like throwing small children in the air and bayoneting them as they descended and shooting elderly women in their beds — the napalm factor is still striking in connecting the bloody imperial dots. It’s even more striking given that the bombs were supplied by US partner-in-crime Israel, which long ago detected lucrative opportunities in making life hell for other human populations, not just Palestinians. The Israeli connection was confirmed in 1983 by then Salvadoran air force commander Rafael Bustillo to a visiting US congressional delegation, as the New York Times reported: “We bought it [the napalm] from Israel several years ago, and used it until 1981. If we hadn’t done that, I might not be sitting here today.” The article went on to note that “the delegation’s report appeared in The Congressional Record of May 26, 1983, shortly after the delegation’s trip, but attracted little notice.” As for the victims of El Mozote who aren’t sitting here today — and who haven’t been sitting here for nearly forty years — obstacles to justice have ranged from a postwar amnesty to pandemic-related delays to obstructive machinations by current Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele of the “New Ideas” party, who appears to be under the impression that fascism is a new idea. The judge in the case is himself effectively under assault and is facing two requests that he recuse himself. As El Faro explains: “If one of those requests succeeds, the hearings will be canceled and the process left in limbo.” A Salvadoran friend of mine, who runs a small shop at a school in San Salvador, recently told me about a cousin of his who joined the Atlacatl Battalion seven years after El Mozote, and whose commander had assured him at the end of the war that the peace accords were a farce and that they’d be back in business at any moment. My friend remarked: “The poor bastard died waiting to return to war; he always carried a hand grenade, and he saw ‘terrorists’ everywhere — even in his soup.” In many ways, indeed, the Salvadoran war never ended. And whatever ultimately happens with the El Mozote trial, it’s already an indictment of a US foreign policy that is fundamentally criminal. \n    left-wing \n  \n  \n    https://americanmind.org/salvo/big-other/ \n    2022-05-02 \n    Peachy Keenan \n    Memo \n    Big Other \n    American Mind \n    When I think about the futuristic dystopian movies of my childhood, I recall giant posters of a Dear Leader with a sinister grin on his face, posted around a gray prison city. Big Brother was watching you, always! We sang along to MTV: “I always feel like somebody’s watching me.”  We were warned. In our present dystopian moment, a new crop of sinister Big Brothers smirks at us from social media and TV, their soulless eyes narrowed, licking their lips as they contemplate how we will taste as they devour us. Recently I have been struck by the sexlessness of our Biden-era Overlords. Gender-neutrality is all the rage in the swamp, I suppose. Men, women, and everything in between have converged into a new subspecies of person with certain traits of both men and women. The Deep State Uberwench, as it were. Broad-shouldered, strong jawed, lipsticked with blown-out hair, power suited and pumped up, they are the end-product of the sausage grinder of execrable NGOs, D.C. institutes, bottomless and fetid think tanks, and toxic universities.  Debrided of a soul and a capacity for self-awareness, what is left after this is a human being disconnected from humanity. Neither male nor female, they are The State: they are Big Other.  “A shape with lion body and the head of a man,/A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun.” Big Other is the product of the ideological and physical strip-mining process that turns normal people into powerful tools of the Regime. It’s fascinating how each person who undergoes this process ends up looking, dressing, and even behaving the same way. It is a new breed of American bureaucrat. Neither fully male or fully female, they inhabit a genderless nether region (they no longer have their originals) where, thus stripped of inconvenient signifiers like “sexy” or “beautiful” or “handsome” or “mother,” they are free to wield their enormous powers more fully.  They have been untethered, unmoored from their original ties to family, self, their identity, and instead roped to the behemoth ship of state.  I am talking about Admiral Rachel Levine, the transgender woman who is Assistant Health Secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, who unaccountably insists that “all” pediatricians believe in “affirming” children’s confusion about gender. I am talking about the powerful transgender activists at Twitter who have sworn to destroy Elon Musk. I am talking about the cabal of Disney employees who are taking the biggest media company on the planet down in a spittle-inflected explosion of rainbow rage.  I am also talking about a particular brand of white liberal female who works for Big Tech and the Federal Government. Big Other includes a sorority of strong women who look like they have been on femininity-suppressing blockers for decades. The Janet Reno option. Ladies like longtime foreign policy barnacle Victoria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and the woman perhaps most responsible for the Ukraine quagmire. Ladies like Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower who accused her former employer of “pushing divisive content for profit.” Haugen, of course, worked in Facebook’s department of “Civic Integrity.” Ladies like Fauci fluffer and CDC director Rachelle Walensky. Ladies like scoldy podium marm Jen Psaki.  These women present as biologically female, and yet come across as thoroughly de-feminized.  A Global Fellow Enters The Chat And now a new queen bee of the hive mind has been crowned. The Biden Administration just created a law enforcement department within the DHS called the “Disinformation Governance Board,” and 33-year-old Nina Jankowicz is Executive Director. Jankowicz is a “global fellow at the nonpartisan Wilson Center and an author whose research has focused on disinformation as well as Russia and the treatment of women online.”  There is a new SHEriff in town, and she’s mad online. In a tweet, Jankowicz posted her official DHS portrait. In the striking photo, she wears something that looks like Hillary Clinton’s pantsuit threw up on Bill’s couch.  The portrait reminds me of a poster that might decorate the set of a dystopian movie from the 1980s, perhaps framed and hanging behind the desk of a glowering gulag matron. Power shoulders, jewel toned jacket snug over a dull plaid dress, that strong jawline, that glossy blowout, her lips pressed into a smirk, she eyes us greedily like a lion on the savanna. I am Nina, hear me roar. Ms. Jankowicz is now in the final instar in the life cycle of the Bug Person. Congratulations, Nina!  The Sound of Muzak Lucky for us, she left a chrysalis bursting with personal vlogs, confessionals, unfunny TikToks, and karaoke nights for us to enjoy. We can all observe this remarkable transformation from larva to nymph to adult. It is like watching a documentary that tells the story of how the Feminist Industrial Complex successfully metamorphosized an entire generation of young, ambitious Glee Club members.  Watch as a pretty, fresh faced Nina earnestly describes her dreams of becoming a “yoga instructor” in an early video. I’m sure this will soon be memory-holed as “disinformation” by the time this is published, so enjoy it while you still can. Her dreams of teaching Downward Facing Dog died, but she still has much to offer her viewers, like an ear-splitting Mary Poppins parody in which she belts out the dangers of “disinformation.”  Julie Andrews would like a word.  If “the worst are full of passionate intensity,” Nina is surely the worst.  And now Ms. Jankowicz, her hour come at last, rolls up her Kundalini mat, slides on her headphones, and cranks up the dial on her Karaoke microphone so she can listen to you tell your husband about the little boy down the street who went to the hospital after his Covid booster.  Maybe she reads the email you send your boomer dad explaining that actually there’s a Nazi brigade on the Ukrainian side and they’re committing war crimes and maybe the U.S. should not be giving those guys weapons.  Maybe Nina’s ice blue eyes go wide and the corner of her mouth curls in anticipation as she hears you whisper to a friend in the carpool line that you are thinking about homeschooling your six-year-old so he doesn’t have to wear his pronoun pin in class anymore.  Big Other is listening now, America. I’d tell you to be afraid of they/them, but it’s hard to fear such people. Perhaps, in the end, the push to fill the highest echelons of the United States Government and everything else with incompetents who fit a diversity checklist will be the petard on which its bloated underbelly is finally hoisted. They will tear it down by virtue of their own unintentionally hilarious goofiness. Recall Robert Conquest’s Third Law of Politics: “The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies.” In other words, hiring her could easily be the act of someone on our side, inserting a poison pill right at the top of the food chain. Perhaps we should be glad to see such clowns presuming to rule over us. The Regime may not make this mistake again! Big Other is so comical that they may actually corrode and dismantle the flimsy house of cards from which they spy on us, without any outside interference.  Therefore, have no fear! Untethered from that which makes they/them human, they and the rest of their Global Fellowship will eventually take on water, founder, and sink below the blood-dimmed tide of their own colossal hubris. \n    right-wing \n  \n  \n    https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/the-long-war-against-terrorism \n    2003-09-08 \n    James Jay Carafano \n    middle-east \n    The Long War Against Terrorism \n    Heritage Commentary \n    Two years down in the war on terror. How many more to go? We don't know. But, given the patience and determination of our enemies -- and the fact that two armed conflicts have yet to dampen their enthusiasm for attacking America -- it's safe to say we have much more work ahead of us than behind us. America's enemies have demonstrated their staying power -- they spent seven years planning the attacks on New York and Washington -- and we must demonstrate ours. We'll have to spend billions of dollars and suffer more casualties before we prevail. Asking if Americans are safer now than they were two years ago poses the wrong question. We can forget about ever being \"safe\" from terrorism again. But we can reasonably expect that terrorists won't run our lives or attack us with impunity -- and that we'll thrive even as we hound our enemies until they join the Soviets in the back pages of history books. But it will take time. Before this is over, the time we spent defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam's forces in Iraq will be to the timeline of the war on terror as the Korean war and the proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan were to the Cold War -- relatively brief flashpoints of action in a long, sustained struggle. Such a war requires our leaders to understand that our staying power, our will to win, is as important as any weapon in our arsenal. Our enemies doubt this. Saddam Hussein said before the first Gulf War that Americans wouldn't tolerate \"10,000 dead in one battle.\" Osama bin Laden said he was emboldened to direct the Sept. 11 attacks because watching support wane for the American operation in Somalia \"convinced us America is a paper tiger.\" Curiously, the public seems to understand the difficulty of the task better than our representatives in Congress. A poll taken in July by The Wall Street Journal and NBC found that 58 percent of Americans think we should stay in Iraq \"as long as necessary to complete the process, even if it takes as long as five years.\" Even after the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was bombed, a Newsweek poll found 70 percent supported maintaining current force levels in Iraq for more than a year, and more than half favored staying 10 years or more if necessary. Our history argues for patience, too. The National Security Act of 1947 created a unified defense department and the CIA, the nation's two premier Cold War weapons. But it took about a decade for these organizations to figure out how best to fight the Russian bear. The instruments used to fight the Soviets -- NATO, our nuclear arsenal and military assistance programs -- emerged during this period. The focus that brought victory over the Soviets emerged over time as well. President Truman at first shelved NSC-68, the master plan to confront the Russians. Defense budgets shrank. The American people were consumed with finding their place in the postwar economic boom. But the Korean War, with losses far exceeding anything seen in the war on terror, brought the Cold War to Main Street. President Eisenhower took office with a clear mandate and a new strategy to build a strong economy, preserve our open society and organize defenses for the long term. President Bush sees himself in the Eisenhower mode. He wants to lay the groundwork to win the long war against terrorism. It won't be easy. The Department of Homeland Security, which combined 22 federal agencies, will need several years to become truly effective. Still, President Bush needs to continue to remind Americans of his plans for homeland security. He needs to rein in spending on new security initiatives. Funding for homeland security has more than doubled since the 9/11 attacks. To add more funds before these are absorbed and committed wisely would be wasteful and counterproductive. The Department of Homeland Security needs to get organized and develop a national response plan as well as strategies for information technology, intelligence sharing and personnel needs. Congress needs to supply funding for emergency responders, intelligence reforms and chemical infrastructure security. State and local governments need to develop regional cooperation plans, share information and methods, and work with the Department of Homeland Security to develop a true national emergency response system. Vast vulnerabilities remain. Two years after 9/11, we need to re-affirm our national commitment to defeating the long-term threat of global terrorism.

He was unpopular even then. At the end of January, he was about five points behind Joe Biden in national polls, which also showed that a small majority of the country disapproved of his job performance. But his numbers had been improving, and he had three great assets going into a campaign year. First, his party was unified in support of him. Unlike every incumbent president who had lost an election since the Great Depression, he had avoided a serious primary challenge. Trump has sided with Republican voters on the issues that large numbers of them care deeply about, from guns to taxes to the courts. That record, and the fact that Democrats are on the other side of those issues, has kept Republican voters with him. Their support has in turn kept Republican politicians in line. The Democrats’ impeachment and attempted removal of Trump from office — remember that? — only strengthened Republicans’ commitment to him. Second, the economy was strong. Democrats were in denial about it, but both economic statistics and public-opinion surveys agreed. Third, the president’s opposition was moving further to the left of public opinion. Several of the Democratic presidential candidates came out for outlawing the private health insurance on which most Americans rely. Republican strategists could hardly believe their luck as a self-described “democratic socialist,” Senator Bernie Sanders, got the most votes in the first three Democratic contests. It all changed rapidly, starting in March. Democratic voters who don’t consider themselves “very liberal” consolidated behind Biden, and clinched the nomination for him. Biden’s victory made it much harder for Trump to base his campaign on fear of left-wing extremism. “He’s not radical Left,” Trump himself has conceded. That same month, the president declared Covid-19 a national emergency, and much of the country shut down. The unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, jumped to 14.7% by April. Trump can argue that the economy is improving, or say that the pre-Covid record vindicates his economic policies. But he no longer has at his disposal the clean case that times are good — which would surely have been a major theme of this convention week if we still had the economy of the start of the year. Trump is down to his first asset, a solid base of support. He continues to do a lot to keep it. When former President Barack Obama delivered a tough critique of him at last week’s Democratic convention, Trump tweeted in response that Obama had spied on him. It’s the sort of riposte that appeals to people already in his corner. But that base won’t be enough for Trump to win re-election, or for his party to avoid losses down ballot. It wasn’t enough in 2016, even with a coalition that was efficiently distributed among the states for electoral power: About a fifth of his voters were people who disapproved of him. And building on his base will now be far harder than it looked in February. At the start of the year, there was a plausible strategy: Convince enough people who didn’t like Trump that they should vote for him anyway, because he had delivered positive results and the opposition was too risky. Now he has to win over people who don’t like him when the economy is weak, close to 200,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the opposition is led by someone who beat a socialist. Republicans have been saying that the Democratic convention was too grim in its depiction of American life and that their own convention will be upbeat. They will surely try to lift Trump’s approval ratings this week. But they may find bringing Biden’s numbers down is more feasible. Trump and other Republicans have already made several attacks on Biden. They may continue to say age has diminished him too much for him to be able to do the job of president, a criticism that plays into the Democrat’s hands by making it easier for him to look competent. They will surely press the argument that the Democrats are too far left, and that Biden will enable rather than restrain them. That strategy attempts to make the election a referendum, not on Trump or even Biden, but on the Democratic Party. The task for Republicans this week is thus clearly defined, if difficult to execute: Persuade some of those voters who don’t approve of how Trump has performed as president that they should fear the Democrats more.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/nyc-primary-votes-really-matter-4248.html\n2013-09-10\nAre you so depressed about the mayoral race you’re thinking about staying away from the polls? Think again. Things are bad. But they could — and can — be worse. Whether you’re a Democratic or Republican, your vote matters — and your vote tomorrow matters more than your vote Nov. 5. New Yorkers may think that their vote doesn’t matter. After all, the Quinnipiac poll shows Public Advocate Bill de Blasio beating his closest competitor two-to-one, and at 43 percent — above the 40 percent he needs to avoid a runoff election with the next top vote-getter. And observers see this lead as solid. Top rivals Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson aren’t doing anything wrong, campaign-wise — so can’t fix the problem. Thompson already ran for mayor and lost — and served as city comptroller, too. Quinn’s been City Council speaker for eight years. John Lindsay’s old motto when voters elected him nearly half a century ago — “He is fresh and everyone else is tired” — fits de Blasio. Then, too, you may think there’s no real policy difference among the Democratic candidates. (That is, they’re uniformly awful.) But even if you’re a liberal, the thought of a de Blasio landslide should make you nervous. The candidate said proudly last week that his tax hike on the rich was the “centerpiece” of his campaign. So the entire reason he’s running is to increase city tax revenues by 1 percent. With solid economic growth, de Blasio could do that easily without hiking taxes. His tax hike isn’t a fiscally responsible way of paying for your new spending. It’s suicidal liberalism for the sake of liberalism. New York needs another three weeks’ worth of a more pragmatic Democrat — either Thompson or Quinn would do fine — pointing out that this is insane. Democrats who really don’t want to be forced to vote for a Republican in two months’ time should think about this now, not then. That said, Republican votes may matter Tuesday more than Democratic ones. Political consultants and “business community” observers terrified of a de Blasio mayor are complacent. They think former MTA chief and Giuliani sidekick Joe Lhota is a shoo-in. He’s got 48 percent of the vote, says Quinnipiac, way more than he needs to avoid a runoff. Plus, Lhota is the guy with experience running a massive transit system, the city’s budget and much of the city’s day-to-day operations. Over him, who on earth would vote for John Catsimatidis — the laughingstock frumpy, slightly nutty-sounding supermarket billionaire whose main idea is a new World’s Fair? Don’t be so sure. “We ain’t never been here before,” says veteran pollster John Zogby, who’s not polling for any candidate in this race. “Catsimatidis is wild, and he’s a wild card.” Why? New York hasn’t had a real contested Republican mayoral primary since 2001, when Herman Badillo ran against Bloomberg. Badillo, the underdog, lost (obviously), solidifying the conventional wisdom that underdogs lose this race. But we’ve never had a race where the underdog — Catsimatidis — was the one spending all the money. “Does the GOP primary matter? Of course it does,” notes Zogby. That’s partly because the general election may be “a hell of a lot more competitive than it may look.” Who voters pick now — on both sides — matters. Catsimatidis has blitzed airwaves and mailboxes for weeks. He’s hitting Lhota where it hurts. Mostly he’s attacking Lhota for raising bridge tolls while he was at the MTA. As a policy matter, this charge is absurd: Catsimatidis won’t say how he would’ve avoided a toll hike. But GOP voters are outer-boroughites who care fiercely about taxes — and they drive. What about the poll? Quinnipiac is a fine outfit. But the number of Republicans it polled is barely in the hundreds. Pollsters have no idea who or how many will vote, or why. With only 45,000 city Republicans having voted in the last contested state-wide primary, all the answers matter. Do the city’s small, mysterious band of Republicans like Rudy Giuliani (who’s endorsed Lhota) more than they hate higher tolls? If you’d like to spend the fall debating reasonable NYPD reforms and fair solutions to the city’s budget crisis rather than discussing whether we should abolish stop, question and frisk or run over kitty-cats, your chance to make a difference is now — not two months down the line. This piece originally appeared in New York Post\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/commentary/personalized-education-while-changing-places-learning\n2014-06-18\nHe currently presides at the McVey Innovative Learning Center (ILC), named for former Hilliard City Schools Superintendent Dale McVey. As I have long believed, Wise argues that schools should no longer take “a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all approach.” And he explains via email, “Four years ago, a group of Hilliard City School educators came together to develop a plan for what (high) schools should look and feel like (here) in the year 2020.” The genesis of the ILC, he says, came from educators’ desire “for a design of a high school of the future. One that personalizes education for each student in a way that allows them to pursue their passion.” Last fall, the ILC opened its doors to more than 800 students. “This next fall,” Wise says, “we have had over 1,200 requests to come to the Innovative Learning Center.” Wise, who is a former classroom teacher, describes the diverse adventures in learning at the ILC: “We have talented music students … so we offer a sound engineering course … Students learn how to make professional recordings while writing and performing their own music. “For the students interested in the world of television journalism and movie production, we offer courses that allow for creative production.” I’m already fantasizing. At my public high school, Boston Latin School, I would have rushed into a course on reporting — with guest professional journalists — in all forms of communication. Wise continues: “For the students that are not successful in the typical classroom, we offer a personalized route of taking classes online and preparing an individual plan. “Students can come here and work in the relaxed atmosphere with their learning coach, at their pace and comfort zone. “We offered a jumpstart on college that provided our students with up to 32 credit hours of college, while they are in high school.” What especially surprised me is the way the ILC builds student confidence by allowing the kids to share their rising skills, which can benefit other learners. Says Wise: “Students could also come here for authentic learning experiences such as our Career Mentorship program, which allows students to go out and mentor in a field of their choice during their class time.” Moreover, “Students interested in becoming an educator could participate in our Teacher Academy and do student teaching while in high school.” Also, “Students interested in entrepreneurship could participate in our business academy.” He emails quotes from students already immersed in the Independent Learning Center: “I get to learn as an individual and the teachers here are willing to work with you in the way that is best for you.” “I enjoy the freedom and ability to be treated as an adult.” “I feel as if there is a higher level of appreciation and respect for education on the parts of students and teachers. There’s also more respect for each other. We’re there for a common goal and also have a common understanding. We all WANT to be there — and that makes a world of difference.” And you may have noticed that the learning there is not most crucially measured by how these students do on collective standardized tests (and in preparing for those tests), which are still required in so many high schools throughout this land. Another quote from a student at the McVey Innovative Learning Center: “The best part of being a student at the ILC is gaining a whole new perspective on learning. I found it much more interesting and applicable to my future to learn concepts in an environment that doesn’t encourage you to be average. I also loved getting to meet people from three other high schools that I never would have met if it weren’t for this class.” And this brings us to how the McVey Innovative Learning Center actually operates. Wise emphasizes, “The ILC is NOT an alternative school. Students come here during their school day … for 90 minutes of their day; the rest of their day they are back at their home high schools.” Obviously, I cannot speak from any experience in having combined time at a regular high school with daily 90‐​minute periods at a contrasting, liberating environment, geared to help me discover what I most wanted for my future and how to get there. Years ago, Duke Ellington wrote a song that has since become a permanent part of me, as it keeps challenging me: Its title: “What Am I Here For?” During my six years at Boston Latin School, if I had been also part of an Innovative Learning Center in that city, I would have had a much clearer sense of what — and how — I needed to learn to keep answering that question of why I’m here. I did develop an unquenchable love of learning during those early years, but little of it from school. Most came from reading — on my own — histories, novels and biographies that raised my expectations of the kind of life I’d want to lead if I knew how. But if there had been an Innovative Learning Center in town, I might have experienced a much more inspiring road ahead. And I expect that may also be true of the futures of many young Americans, of all sorts of backgrounds, if each gets a personalized, expanding education.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/blog/did-citizens-united-critics-push-irs-misbehave\n2013-05-13\nLast Friday, a spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted the agency had targeted various Tea Party and related groups during the 2010 election cycle. Later in the week, an Inspector General’s report will offer an initial look at the facts of this matter. At least two congressional committees also plan investigations. Many people recall that the Nixon administration used the IRS to harass political opponents. Surely the IG’s report and subsequent investigations will show whether the IRS has gotten back into the business of protecting an incumbent administration from its critics. It is not too soon, however, to recall the the campaign finance reform lobby has been calling for a crackdown on political groups since the Citizens United decision. One possibility would be that the IRS gave in pressure from the reform lobby and went after the Tea Party groups. Was there an intention to chill speech? The timing provokes doubts: the targeting began in the spring of 2010 just as the mid‐​term campaign season started and ended after the election when the harassment no longer has any rationale. The long delays of approving tax status certainly slowed down the wave coming toward Congress in 2010. 66 House members lost their seats in that election. Do any sitting members owe their offices to the IRS? Even now, leading reform groups are calling for renewed crackdown on these groups. We are also told by more sober reformers that this whole matter shows the need for more disclosure and greater clarity in the rules. But the major argument against such disclosure has been that government officials will use the information to punish political opponents. Given what we know about this case, does it make sense to give the IRS more information about, and more power over groups that oppose the administration? Some will note the irony here. Most of campaign finance law was enacted in 1974 just after the end of the Watergate scandal. The campaign finance reform lobby dates its life to that scandal which, as noted, included using the IRS for political ends. Now the reformers are defending the IRS and its apparent political harassment. Things do seem to have come full circle.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.mercatus.org/economic-insights/expert-commentary/christmas-carol-do-gooders-dickensian-times\n2019-12-20\nOutside of the gospels, A Christmas Carol is probably the most famous Christmas story on earth. Dickens not only wrote a wildly imaginative story filled with wonderful characters, but he infused in it a plea for tolerance and generosity. Not surprisingly, when most people think of this timeless novella, they recall Charles Dickens’s reflections on Christmas spirit and the true meaning of the holiday. But this story can shed light on important economic principles as well. Purportedly written in a frenzied six weeks, A Christmas Carol was Dickens’s emotional response to the treatment of the poor. When reading this book (or almost anything by Dickens for that matter), the dismal socioeconomic landscape of England is vividly depicted. Indeed, in Dickens’s portrayals of the poor, particularly the urban poor, people are often living grim, gloomy, and destitute lives. What’s more, he expresses his discontent with treatment of the poor pointedly and without restraint, and for good reason. As the era of mass industry dawned in Europe and people migrated from rural areas to cities, the number of desperately poor and homeless people increased dramatically. It would have been bad enough if this new destitute class had merely been ignored. Instead, some of the government remedies to “fix” the problem ended up looking more like persecution of the poor. Noting the steep increase in the nation’s number of poor people, British government officials quickly enacted legislation to ease the public burden of poverty, the most prominent example being the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. This legislation claimed to assist the poor—at that time known by the charming Malthusian label of the “surplus population”—by funneling government relief into what were called “workhouses.” These establishments were notorious for conditions so undesirable that only the truly destitute would seek relief there, and as Dickens wrote in A Christmas Carol, “many would rather die” than endure them. The laws were intended to encourage poor people to stay off the streets and go out to find work, but it had no effect: because the workhouses were so unbearable, poor people decided they would rather be anyplace but there. The Poor Laws weren’t the only example of government regulation aggravating the problem. During Dickensian times, some bakeries would allow the poor to use their ovens on Sundays, since they were closed for the Sabbath. But legislation repeatedly targeted this practice in the name of preserving religious observance. Dickens invokes this in A Christmas Carol when the main character of the story, the literature’s most famous miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, speaks with the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge suggests that the spirit should prevent the poor from eating on the Sabbath, saying that the law prohibiting sharing ovens “has been done in your name.” The ghost responds in righteous anger at the implication and says that while there are some who pass laws like these “in our name,” Scrooge should “charge their doings on them, not us.” Not only does this demonstrate Dickens’s personal disdain for those who do morally reprehensible things in the name of religion, but it also shows the effect government overregulation has on those who try to help their less fortunate neighbors. This act of shutting down ovens seems counterproductive and even barbaric, but is it really that different than some government policies today? Consider the widespread prohibitions on providing food for homeless people. Many government regulations prevent people from providing poorer individuals with food, sometimes requiring licenses in the name of safety. In one ghastly case, Missouri health authorities went so far as to pour bleach on food meant for homeless individuals. Dickens would undoubtedly be appalled, but almost certainly not surprised. While this overregulation seems to be well-intentioned, it hurts poor people by removing their access to charity, and it thwarts those who want to help them. Perhaps the most important takeaway from A Christmas Carol is the underlying principle of voluntary charity. Government regulation may interfere with charitable acts, but through the transformation of Scrooge, Dickens shows that individuals have great power to improve the lives of others. Christmas is a reminder that are all charged to help one another and treat those in need as people, or as Dickens put it, “fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.” Christmastime should remind us that when government fails, it is the responsibility of individuals to help those in need.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/student-loan-default-crisis-borrowers-children/\n2017-11-15\nAttending college as a parent can be a daunting affair: It’s hard to find enough hours in the day for work, family, and school. Many institutions do not offer any child care and classes may only be available at inconvenient times. For many student-parents these stresses are too much to handle; only one-third of undergraduate parents finish a credential within six years of enrolling. Now, new data show another challenge for student-parents: repaying their federal loans. The analyses presented here show that almost half of student-parents who began college in the 2003-04 school year and borrowed a federal loan for their undergraduate education defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. That’s double the rate of borrowers without children. Even worse, 70 percent of student-parents who defaulted were single. For African Americans, single parents made up 90 percent of student-parent defaulters. As a result, 1 in 10 undergraduate borrowers was a single parent, but these students represented 2 out of every 5 undergraduate defaulters. For these borrowers, who are often the sole providers for the family, default can keep them entrenched in their current financial situations, making it all the more difficult to improve their circumstances. Student-parents are not a small subset of higher education enrollment. There are about 4.8 million undergraduates who are parents, 2.7 million of whom borrow to cover the costs of school. Students with children are disproportionately women of color, and most are enrolled at community and for-profit colleges. When these students borrow and default, they are thrust into a financial situation that is difficult to remedy. Combined with low completion rates, these figures demonstrate how much our higher education system struggles to serve those who need extra assistance. When student-parents don’t have access to comprehensive support systems, they suffer, both while enrolled and after. The federal government, states, and institutions must find ways to better address the needs of student-parents if the goal is to give them the opportunity to provide a better future for themselves and their families. The consequences of default Borrowers who default on their loans see their credit scores plummet, making it harder to take on additional debt, to rent or purchase a home, or to even get a job. The federal government can garnish wages and tax returns of defaulted borrowers, even if they are low-income. Defaulted borrowers also lose access to additional federal financial aid, which can compromise their ability to re-enroll in school. This is a big problem for student-parents who default, 54 percent of whom did not earn a credential. These consequences can compromise the ability of student-parents, particularly those who are single, to provide adequate resources and opportunities for their families. Lower default rates would allow more student-parents to experience the potential socioeconomic returns of a college education. Fewer defaults would also benefit the nation as a whole. Taxpayer dollars could be diverted to student outreach instead of being spent attempting to collect defaulted loans. Americans could also have confidence that our student loan system is built to serve students, even when they face difficult odds. Almost half of student-parents default on their loans Nearly half of students with children who entered college in 2004—46 percent—defaulted on their federal loans within 12 years. That’s 1.5 times the rate of all undergraduates and almost twice the rate of borrowers without children. As a result, students with children were only 17 percent of undergraduate borrowers but represented 27 percent of all undergraduate loan defaults Even though for-profit colleges enrolled 20 percent of all undergraduate borrowers, 60 percent of student-parents who defaulted started at these institutions. In fact, 44 percent of for-profit defaulters were parents, the highest share of any sector. That’s double the share of community colleges and 10 times the share of public, four-year institutions. These data fall in line with other research that shows that students who first enroll at for-profit colleges have higher default rates than other types of institutions. However, the default rates for student-parents at for-profits are disproportionately high compared to default rates for all borrowers, which could suggest that these colleges are not providing the resources student-parents need to succeed. Default rates are even worse for parents of young children Parents of young children particularly struggled to repay their loans. Fifty-three percent of students with children age 3 or younger defaulted, compared to 31 percent of parents with teenagers. This is perhaps because students with older children have fewer child care costs and obligations, which allows them to devote more time and resources to school. Again, students who enrolled at for-profit colleges had the worst outcomes. At these colleges, sixty-four percent of student-parents with young children defaulted on their loans within 12 years of enrolling. As a result, one-quarter of all undergraduate defaulters at for-profits had children age 3 or younger. The plight of single parents Perhaps most troubling is how many defaulted borrowers were single parents. Single parents make up two-thirds of student-parents who default, and account for 18 percent of all undergraduate defaults. High rates of default have important implications for these families. When students who have partners default, they are often able to lean on the credit and finances of the other parent to make ends meet as the former student resolves the default. However, for single parents, there may not be another adult who can support the family. This can keep single-parent families in dire economic circumstances for a much longer period, if they are ever able to get out. African Americans and Latinos make up 60 percent of defaulted single parents Undergraduates of color are more likely to have children than their white counterparts, and the data show that they are also a larger proportion of student-parents who default. African Americans and Latinos made up 52 percent of all student-parents (and 60 percent of all single parents) who defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. The default issue is particularly acute for single African American student-parents. Almost 90 percent of defaulted African American students with children were single. That share was 64 percent for Latino student-parents, 10 percentage points higher than for white student-parents. These data provide further evidence that single parents, especially those of color, should be a primary group of concern. CAP recently revealed the extent to which African American borrowers struggle to repay their student loans, and the analyses presented here provide further evidence that underrepresented students experience particularly poor outcomes. To confront these problems, the Department of Education must collect data on borrowers’ race to better understand these problems and develop effective solutions. What can be done to help borrowers with children? Parents who go to school seeking a better life for themselves and their children deserve better odds than a coin flip that they might default on their loans. The data show that the size of the loan balances of students with children are not the problem. Quite the opposite. Across all types of colleges, student-parents who defaulted had smaller balances than those who did not. This holds true for single parents as well as students who are raising children with a partner. Why are student-parents defaulting at such high rates? It is difficult to say without additional data, but the federal government, states, and institutions can take several steps to improve the educational experiences of these students, which can help keep them complete college and improve their repayment outcomes. On the repayment side, the federal government should examine whether student-parents are able to take advantage of plans that tie monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes. Unfortunately, the students included in these data enrolled six years* before Income-Based Repayment became available, which could partly explain these negative outcomes. However, more than 1 million borrowers default every year, raising questions as to whether students who would benefit from income-driven repayment options are using these plans. If they are not, the federal government should conduct additional research on default, and put together focus groups and other consumer testing to figure out why borrowers don’t use these plans. Policymakers can also do more to keep undergraduates with children from having to take on debt in the first place. The federal government and states should extend public assistance programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to more adults enrolled in college to help offset the costs of student-parents. States should be more supportive of these students by guaranteeing them state grant aid and extending promise—often called free college—initiatives beyond recent high school graduates. On the institutional side, free or subsidized child care, flexible course schedules, and opportunities to earn credit by assessing students’ current knowledge and skills can help reduce student-parents’ costs and the time they spend enrolled. If the aim of the America’s higher education system is to provide an escape from poverty and to spur the prosperity of those who have been historically marginalized, then ensuring that student-parents are able to successfully repay their debt is a must. Student-parents should be getting more from our higher education system, and policymakers have the power to improve their outcomes.

She won by just over two hundred votes in a race that went down to the wire. The outcome wasn’t determined until two days after the election, as mail-in ballots streamed in after election day. Six hundred ballots have been challenged and could still be counted, but they are not expected to change the recall’s outcome. Sawant won largely based on a concerted effort to get out the youth vote. Among all demographics, the eighteen to twenty-five cohort was the only one which increased its turnout from the most recent election, held only one month earlier. Three hundred more voters in that age group voted in this election compared to last month, and those three hundred were largely the margin of victory. To indicate the level of interest in the race: last month’s general election turnout was 43 percent. Turnout for the Sawant recall — a single-candidate special election — was 53 percent. Seattle’s capitalists have tried repeatedly to stamp out Sawant and her socialist politics from City Hall since her election in 2014. Repeatedly, they have failed. In 2013, Seattle voters elected Sawant for the first time. Since then, she has been the council’s most radical member. Though she has collaborated with fellow progressives on various legislative issues, Sawant is known for her take-no-prisoners style. She does not triangulate. She does not compromise for the sake of legislative success. She asserts her politics without fear. Though this makes her a target for conservative business interests who continually brand her as a dangerous extremist, it also earns her the passionate support of the city’s progressive voters. In celebrating the passage of a resolution taxing Amazon and other major companies in order to build low-income housing, she unabashedly confronted Jeff Bezos: We were clear-eyed about naming the real force pulling the strings: Amazon. Many argued that we should not “antagonize” big business and instead try to broker a deal, but we know that our power comes from working people getting organized, not from any negotiation with the elite. For those watching from outside Seattle, don’t let anyone tell you in your fight to tax big business in your city that you’re being divisive, because class struggle is what gets the goods. The private, for-profit housing market has utterly failed working people. Not just here and now, but everywhere and always. Because capitalism is completely incapable of meeting the most basic needs of working people. Internationally, the working class needs to take the top 500 corporations into democratic public ownership, run by workers, in the interests of human need and the environment, not billionaire greed. I have a message for Jeff Bezos and his class. If you attempt again to overturn the Amazon Tax, working people will go all out in the thousands to defeat you. And we will not stop there. Because you see, we are fighting for far more than this tax, we are preparing the ground for a different kind of society. And if you, Jeff Bezos, want to drive that process forward by lashing out against us in our modest demands, then so be it. Because we are coming for you and your rotten system. We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state. We cannot and will not stop until we overthrow it and replace it with a world based instead on solidarity, genuine democracy, and equality — a socialist world. She is an Indian immigrant who earned a degree in computer science at the University of Mumbai and began her career as a software engineer. She currently teaches economics at two local community colleges and is a leader of the Socialist Alternative. Sawant is a fiery speaker known for her speeches at local protests. She has championed several issues beloved by local progressives including demanding that local companies pay more in taxes to support housing for the homeless and education. Her local campaign for a $15 minimum wage helped build momentum for similar laws around the country. She has also championed renters’ rights and an eviction moratorium during the COVID epidemic. Sawant is unsparing and unrepentant in espousing her radical views. For that reason, she serves as a third rail in Seattle politics. Her colleagues may join with her on some issues, but they often steer clear in order to avoid the pushback the “radical socialist” receives. Landlords, real estate developers, and Big Tech routinely recruit candidates and donate large sums to unseat her. So far, they’ve failed in two previous elections. Last year, business decided to take a different tack. Since they could not defeat her in a general election, they decided to attempt a recall. They cleverly determined that scheduling the recall during a regular election would tend to increase turnout, which would not be to their advantage — from the anti-Sawant point of view, the fewer voters who showed up for the recall, the better. So they delayed registering their campaign in order to force a special election in which this single issue would be on the ballot. Anti-Sawant forces also raised over $1 million to fund TV commercials, glossy mailers and radio spots targeting her as a law-breaking extremist who would encourage mobs to attack City Hall and the homeless to take over the city stately neighborhoods. They even created a separate PAC enabling donors to give unlimited funds to support the recall. A Better Seattle raised $200,000 from its largely corporate donor base. To give a sense of how much money they spent: in the last election in which Sawant was reelected, the Chamber of Commerce PAC spent a then-unprecedented $1 million on all four of the council races (including Sawant’s). This time they spent that much just to defeat a single candidate: her. What the recall campaign had in well-heeled donors, the Sawant campaign made up for in committed small donors. And she matched her opponents virtually dollar for dollar. Despite Sawant’s victory, we should not expect the backlash threat of the corporate elite to decline. We saw this in the write-in campaign against Buffalo’s democratic socialist mayoral candidate, India Walton, which restored to office the Democratic machine mayor who’d lost the primary. Capital does not like losing, and it will retrench and return to the fray whenever left candidates like Sawant and Walton emerge. The victory over the Seattle recall takes some of the sting out of the defeat of progressive candidates for mayor and city attorney in November’s general election. It confirms that an avowedly progressive socialist message still resonates among Seattle voters. Those defeats were, in part, a backlash against last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, in which activists occupied the heart of the city’s Capitol Hill in June 2020. Two of the incidents emphasized by the recall proponents against Sawant were her participation in a march on City Hall, in which she used her key to open the building for the protesters. Separately, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter organized a march on Mayor Jenny Durkan’s home for which Sawant was blamed. Concurrent with the Capitol Hill occupation, the city’s corporate power structure was running a competing campaign portraying the city as “dying” due to crime, vandalism, and homeless encampments “invading” schools and neighborhoods. The city’s Sinclair Broadcasting affiliate, KOMO News, produced a special with the death-rattle title “Seattle Is Dying,” drawing national attention to these right-wing talking points. The TV evening news showed hundreds of stories of gang violence, shootings, and murders. They produced stories about fires, drug dealing, and murder at homeless encampments. The Seattle Times, owned for a hundred thirty years by a single wealthy Republican family, breathlessly hyped these developments on its news and editorial pages. During the year between the Capitol Hill occupation and the November election, the anti-homeless media campaign had a major impact. The city council, passed a 20 percent cut to the police department budget. But the mayoral candidate who ultimately won in the November election opposes any cut at all. By November, the enthusiasm and commitment which the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) had infused into Seattle had dissipated. That explains the electoral defeats mentioned earlier. The good news is that Sawant’s victory has arrested the momentum of the corporate elite. There will be no stampede to rid the city of its homeless population. The Left still has a strong voice in Seattle.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2016/dec/medicare-debate-intensify-democrats-draw-battle-lines\n2016-12-05\nBy Kerry Young, CQ Roll Call November 30, 2016 -- Republicans do not yet have a united approach on whether to push to make significant changes in Medicare. But Democrats are already pouncing on the opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of seniors and people with disabilities against Republicans who want to gut the entitlement program. \"\"It's clear that Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\"\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who will lead the chamber's Democrats next year, on Tuesday. Lawmakers may turn to a debate about the future of Medicare after Republicans take steps to partially repeal the 2010 health care law, which President-elect Donald Trump has set as a priority. House GOP aides are already working on legislative language for repeal. House Republicans have been pressing for years for a major shift in Medicare, with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., advocating for a move toward a defined contribution program. Under such a program, seniors would be given a set amount of money to shop for a Medicare plan. Critics say that if capped spending doesn't keep up with health care costs, seniors could suffer. Under GOP proposals, insurers would play a larger role than they already do in managing Medicare. Already, private Medicare Advantage plans cover roughly one of every three people enrolled in Medicare, which serves people who are 65 and older or who have significant disabilities. But some Senate Republicans don't appear as anxious as their House counterparts to jump into such a politically risky debate. Schumer already is predicting that GOP efforts to further privatize Medicare will falter, as did their plans for Social Security after their 2004 electoral victory. Some Medicare changes may fall outside what can easily be handled through the fast-track legislative mechanism that House Republicans are eyeing to quickly undo parts of the 2010 health care law, said Joseph Antos, a researcher with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The rules for using so-called budget reconciliation allow measures to proceed with simple majorities in the Senate and thus avoid filibusters, but the tool can only be used in limited circumstances. Rules named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., narrow the number of items to be included in a reconciliation bill to those with the clearest connection to changes in federal spending and revenue. \"\"All that is so complex and time-consuming that Medicare will have to wait, at least in terms of big decisions,\"\" Antos told CQ Roll Call. \"\"The big push will probably not be in 2017 unless there is a grand package of reforms\"\" that sweeps in Medicare and Medicaid, the joint federal–state health program for low-income people. Senate Republicans Reluctant Some Senate Republicans don't expect Congress to tackle a Medicare debate next year and say that it would not happen as part of the repeal of the 2010 health care law. \"\"My impression is that everyone would see [the health law] repeal as an issue in and of itself. It may have some Medicaid components, but I doubt that it has many Medicare components,\"\" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., told CQ Roll Call. Moran also said he's concerned that House lawmakers will eye Medicare as a source of savings to be used for other purposes. \"\"My view is that any changes in Medicare would be designed to strengthen and improve Medicare, and it should not be a source for funding other things,\"\" he said. Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Tuesday he doesn't think that changes to Medicare should be part of next year's repeal effort. \"\"I think that falls under the rule of not biting off more than you can chew,\"\" the Tennessee Republican told reporters. \"\"One of the Democrats' big problems with Obamacare was they tried to do too much, too fast. I think the problems about the solvency of Medicare should be left for another debate, another discussion.\"\" Sen. Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is one of a handful of Democrats who say they would oppose Trump's nomination of House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services due to his support for plans to alter Medicare. \"\"The nomination vote on Tom Price is the first test of whether Congress is prepared to stand up to the Republicans' clear desire to end Medicare as we know it,\"\" Murphy said in a statement. Still, some Senate Republicans are anxious for a broad discussion of changes to the so-called entitlement programs that rest at the heart of the nation's budget woes. \"\"The big deal that we've got to do is going to have to include Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,\"\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. Flake said he expected this work would have to wait until after completion of the effort to partially repeal the 2010 health care law. \"\"It's tough to see how it all fits in. It's a packed schedule, so I'd be surprised to see a serious discussion of Medicare in the months ahead,\"\" he said. In contrast, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said it's possible that a broader conversation about changes to Medicare could emerge in the Obamacare repeal debate. \"\"It will be a part of the conversation,\"\" Isakson said. \"\"Everything is going to be open for grabs.\"\"\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/article/miscalculating-tunisia\n2021-07-28\nOn July 25, Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the country’s prime minister and suspended parliament for 30 days. Security forces were then deployed around the parliament building in Tunis, blocking legislators from passing through. The next day, the president forced out the acting justice minister, sacked the defense minister, and ordered the offices of Al Jazeera closed. He also banned gatherings of three people or more. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Rached Ghannouchi, the speaker of the now shuttered parliament and longtime leader of the Islamist Ennahdha party, called Saied’s action a “coup.” The president disagreed, citing Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which gives the head of state the power to do precisely what he did in the event of “imminent danger threatening the integrity of the country and the country’s security and independence.” There is a significant difference of opinion, however, as to whether Tunisia’s current dire economic problems, parliamentary drift, and a debilitating wave of COVID-19 actually amount to such imminent danger. This would seem to be a problem that the Constitutional Court could adjudicate—but alas, there is no court because either no one can agree on which judges to appoint or the president has blocked their appointment. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy Coup or no coup, this was not supposed to happen in Tunisia. Tunisia is (or was) the “lone success story” of the Arab Spring. But these kinds of clichés, used by international media over and over for a decade, were themselves always a problem. They framed Tunisian politics in a way that closed off other possibilities—like backsliding—and envisaged linear developments from protests to elections to a constitution. When breathless editorials described a peaceful transfer of power to a “genuine democracy,” they stripped out the complexity of Tunisian politics specifically and transitions to democracy more generally.

Tunisians have been on the brink before, including during an extended political stalemate in 2013. Then, in 2015, newly elected President Beji Caid Essebsi preferred a government that would have excluded Ennahdha and its allies. Unfortunately for Essebsi and the secularists of his Nidaa Tounes party, the parliamentary math did not work in his favor, forcing a broader coalition. Goodwill eventually developed between the president and Ghannouchi, but what seemed more important than personality in forcing a compromise was the very fact that neither Essebsi nor Ghannouchi had the kind of popular support necessary to impose his will on the other—an apparent benefit of a divided society. It was laudable and notable that Tunisia did not descend into violence in 2013, that a workable coalition government was established in 2015, and that there was a peaceful transfer of power after Essebsi died in 2019––though none of these achievements necessarily meant that Tunisia was going to continue to progress. Serious analysts knew this because they understood the country’s economic challenges, the lingering questions around identity, the yen for the old order among elites, and the inability of parliament to make good on the promise of the January 2011 revolution. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Yet curiously, some of these same experts and observers continued to describe Tunisia straightforwardly as a success—creating an unwritten and unacknowledged expectation that the country’s progress would invariably continue. This was especially odd, given the ongoing erosion in the past decade of democratic institutions in countries considered consolidated democracies––including the United States. In the few days since Saied gave himself executive authority, there have been protests both in support and opposition to his actions. The former are more interesting. Dispatches from Tunisia indicate that those hailing the president have had enough of poor governance and a lack of economic opportunity. Layer into these problems the fact that a recent wave of COVID-19 has devastated the country’s health care system, and a lot more people seem willing to bet on an authoritarian who promises to make their lives better with more unencumbered power at his disposal. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy The readiness to part with hard-won gains after a decade of democratization seems to be part and parcel of Tunisia’s particular political culture. No, I’m not referring to the canard that Arab and Muslim societies are unpracticed at democracy; rather, I mean to draw attention to the cultural legacy of the big Arab state that promised (but rarely, if ever, delivered) security, education, and opportunity. The analysts, journalists, and civil society activists with whom Westerners tend to interact in Tunisia want to forge a more just and democratic society. But what about Tunisians more broadly? Many—or at least the ones in the streets in the last few days—seem to have a more ambivalent relationship with democracy. They seem to want a more effective state that can deliver jobs and a social safety net regardless of the character of the political system. It is possible that after a decade in which Tunisians enjoyed greater personal freedoms, the lack of prosperity has made a potentially significant number of them more willing to give some version of authoritarianism another try. Of course, it remains entirely unclear what will happen in Tunisia and what foreign powers can do about it. Given how much attention the press and experts have lavished on Tunisia since the overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, combined with U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to a values-based foreign policy, there will be at least some pressure for the United States to respond. Yet here is the conundrum: In Washington, Tunisia tends to be viewed through the prism of its presumed success. Thus, experts and activists have advocated for providing more assistance to Tunisia precisely because it is alleged to have made the transition to democracy. The United States has also developed a security relationship with Tunisia based on fighting extremism. Should the United States now withhold or cut this aid? That would seem appropriate in terms of values but perhaps risky when it comes to security, given Tunisia’s penchant for producing extremists and instability in the neighboring Sahel region. This is not an easy circle to square. In what would be one of the more unexpected developments in U.S. Middle East policy, Tunisia may end up being a cautionary tale in building a policy around a regime type because political systems can change—quickly.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.demos.org/blog/one-job-too-many-ceo-shouldnt-also-be-chairman\n2013-05-14\nWith Jamie Dimon under growing fire from shareholders of JP Morgan Chase, one possibility is that he may relinquish his role as chairman of the board but remain as CEO. That raises an interesting question: Why does Dimon hold both jobs to begin with? The answer is that it's common practice at many corporations for the CEO to also be chair, known as \"\"duality.\"\" Surveys have found that CEOs also hold the chair position in the majority of large corporations. But why is that? After all, isn't the job of a board to supervise the CEO and organization as a whole -- or at least closely monitor things? In fact it is. So who came up with idea of having the CEO also lead the body that is supposed to be his or her boss? Arguments for duality rest, in part, on the idea that it is more efficient and effective to have one person fully in charge. And anyone who has ever seen the president and the board chair of an organization end up at odds knows that there is something to this logic. But the conflicts of interest inherent in duality would seem to militate clearly in favor of dividing these jobs. I mean, doesn't anyone remember the scandals of the Enron era, where you had imperial CEOs like Bernard Ebbers of Worldcom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco driving their companies into the ground? Don't people remember the way that CEOs packed boards -- and especially board compensation and audit committees -- with cronies that wrote them a blank check at shareholder expense? Come to think of it, forget all that ancient history. What about all the imperial bank CEOs-Chairmen, like Merrill's Stanley O'Neal, who led their firms to gorge on toxic assets without any real supervision? A key takeaway of all these scandals is that boards needed to be more independent, and the good news is that both regulatory changes and voluntarily corporate actions have reduced the pervasiveness of duality over the past decade. But this bad idea lives on, as we see at JP Morgan and many other companies. In some countries, duality is illegal. That should be the case here. One footnote: duality is very rare in the nonprofit sector. The president of Princeton University isn't also chair of its board of trustees. The president of Ford isn't wielding the gavel at the foundation's board meetings. Maybe there are nonprofits where the CEO and chair jobs are combined, but I don't know of any.\nleft-wing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Sample Data"

He was unpopular even then. At the end of January, he was about five points behind Joe Biden in national polls, which also showed that a small majority of the country disapproved of his job performance. But his numbers had been improving, and he had three great assets going into a campaign year. First, his party was unified in support of him. Unlike every incumbent president who had lost an election since the Great Depression, he had avoided a serious primary challenge. Trump has sided with Republican voters on the issues that large numbers of them care deeply about, from guns to taxes to the courts. That record, and the fact that Democrats are on the other side of those issues, has kept Republican voters with him. Their support has in turn kept Republican politicians in line. The Democrats’ impeachment and attempted removal of Trump from office — remember that? — only strengthened Republicans’ commitment to him. Second, the economy was strong. Democrats were in denial about it, but both economic statistics and public-opinion surveys agreed. Third, the president’s opposition was moving further to the left of public opinion. Several of the Democratic presidential candidates came out for outlawing the private health insurance on which most Americans rely. Republican strategists could hardly believe their luck as a self-described “democratic socialist,” Senator Bernie Sanders, got the most votes in the first three Democratic contests. It all changed rapidly, starting in March. Democratic voters who don’t consider themselves “very liberal” consolidated behind Biden, and clinched the nomination for him. Biden’s victory made it much harder for Trump to base his campaign on fear of left-wing extremism. “He’s not radical Left,” Trump himself has conceded. That same month, the president declared Covid-19 a national emergency, and much of the country shut down. The unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, jumped to 14.7% by April. Trump can argue that the economy is improving, or say that the pre-Covid record vindicates his economic policies. But he no longer has at his disposal the clean case that times are good — which would surely have been a major theme of this convention week if we still had the economy of the start of the year. Trump is down to his first asset, a solid base of support. He continues to do a lot to keep it. When former President Barack Obama delivered a tough critique of him at last week’s Democratic convention, Trump tweeted in response that Obama had spied on him. It’s the sort of riposte that appeals to people already in his corner. But that base won’t be enough for Trump to win re-election, or for his party to avoid losses down ballot. It wasn’t enough in 2016, even with a coalition that was efficiently distributed among the states for electoral power: About a fifth of his voters were people who disapproved of him. And building on his base will now be far harder than it looked in February. At the start of the year, there was a plausible strategy: Convince enough people who didn’t like Trump that they should vote for him anyway, because he had delivered positive results and the opposition was too risky. Now he has to win over people who don’t like him when the economy is weak, close to 200,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the opposition is led by someone who beat a socialist. Republicans have been saying that the Democratic convention was too grim in its depiction of American life and that their own convention will be upbeat. They will surely try to lift Trump’s approval ratings this week. But they may find bringing Biden’s numbers down is more feasible. Trump and other Republicans have already made several attacks on Biden. They may continue to say age has diminished him too much for him to be able to do the job of president, a criticism that plays into the Democrat’s hands by making it easier for him to look competent. They will surely press the argument that the Democrats are too far left, and that Biden will enable rather than restrain them. That strategy attempts to make the election a referendum, not on Trump or even Biden, but on the Democratic Party. The task for Republicans this week is thus clearly defined, if difficult to execute: Persuade some of those voters who don’t approve of how Trump has performed as president that they should fear the Democrats more.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/nyc-primary-votes-really-matter-4248.html\n2013-09-10\nAre you so depressed about the mayoral race you’re thinking about staying away from the polls? Think again. Things are bad. But they could — and can — be worse. Whether you’re a Democratic or Republican, your vote matters — and your vote tomorrow matters more than your vote Nov. 5. New Yorkers may think that their vote doesn’t matter. After all, the Quinnipiac poll shows Public Advocate Bill de Blasio beating his closest competitor two-to-one, and at 43 percent — above the 40 percent he needs to avoid a runoff election with the next top vote-getter. And observers see this lead as solid. Top rivals Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson aren’t doing anything wrong, campaign-wise — so can’t fix the problem. Thompson already ran for mayor and lost — and served as city comptroller, too. Quinn’s been City Council speaker for eight years. John Lindsay’s old motto when voters elected him nearly half a century ago — “He is fresh and everyone else is tired” — fits de Blasio. Then, too, you may think there’s no real policy difference among the Democratic candidates. (That is, they’re uniformly awful.) But even if you’re a liberal, the thought of a de Blasio landslide should make you nervous. The candidate said proudly last week that his tax hike on the rich was the “centerpiece” of his campaign. So the entire reason he’s running is to increase city tax revenues by 1 percent. With solid economic growth, de Blasio could do that easily without hiking taxes. His tax hike isn’t a fiscally responsible way of paying for your new spending. It’s suicidal liberalism for the sake of liberalism. New York needs another three weeks’ worth of a more pragmatic Democrat — either Thompson or Quinn would do fine — pointing out that this is insane. Democrats who really don’t want to be forced to vote for a Republican in two months’ time should think about this now, not then. That said, Republican votes may matter Tuesday more than Democratic ones. Political consultants and “business community” observers terrified of a de Blasio mayor are complacent. They think former MTA chief and Giuliani sidekick Joe Lhota is a shoo-in. He’s got 48 percent of the vote, says Quinnipiac, way more than he needs to avoid a runoff. Plus, Lhota is the guy with experience running a massive transit system, the city’s budget and much of the city’s day-to-day operations. Over him, who on earth would vote for John Catsimatidis — the laughingstock frumpy, slightly nutty-sounding supermarket billionaire whose main idea is a new World’s Fair? Don’t be so sure. “We ain’t never been here before,” says veteran pollster John Zogby, who’s not polling for any candidate in this race. “Catsimatidis is wild, and he’s a wild card.” Why? New York hasn’t had a real contested Republican mayoral primary since 2001, when Herman Badillo ran against Bloomberg. Badillo, the underdog, lost (obviously), solidifying the conventional wisdom that underdogs lose this race. But we’ve never had a race where the underdog — Catsimatidis — was the one spending all the money. “Does the GOP primary matter? Of course it does,” notes Zogby. That’s partly because the general election may be “a hell of a lot more competitive than it may look.” Who voters pick now — on both sides — matters. Catsimatidis has blitzed airwaves and mailboxes for weeks. He’s hitting Lhota where it hurts. Mostly he’s attacking Lhota for raising bridge tolls while he was at the MTA. As a policy matter, this charge is absurd: Catsimatidis won’t say how he would’ve avoided a toll hike. But GOP voters are outer-boroughites who care fiercely about taxes — and they drive. What about the poll? Quinnipiac is a fine outfit. But the number of Republicans it polled is barely in the hundreds. Pollsters have no idea who or how many will vote, or why. With only 45,000 city Republicans having voted in the last contested state-wide primary, all the answers matter. Do the city’s small, mysterious band of Republicans like Rudy Giuliani (who’s endorsed Lhota) more than they hate higher tolls? If you’d like to spend the fall debating reasonable NYPD reforms and fair solutions to the city’s budget crisis rather than discussing whether we should abolish stop, question and frisk or run over kitty-cats, your chance to make a difference is now — not two months down the line.

As I have long believed, Wise argues that schools should no longer take “a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all approach.” And he explains via email, “Four years ago, a group of Hilliard City School educators came together to develop a plan for what (high) schools should look and feel like (here) in the year 2020.” The genesis of the ILC, he says, came from educators’ desire “for a design of a high school of the future. One that personalizes education for each student in a way that allows them to pursue their passion.” Last fall, the ILC opened its doors to more than 800 students. “This next fall,” Wise says, “we have had over 1,200 requests to come to the Innovative Learning Center.” Wise, who is a former classroom teacher, describes the diverse adventures in learning at the ILC: “We have talented music students … so we offer a sound engineering course … Students learn how to make professional recordings while writing and performing their own music. “For the students interested in the world of television journalism and movie production, we offer courses that allow for creative production.” I’m already fantasizing. At my public high school, Boston Latin School, I would have rushed into a course on reporting — with guest professional journalists — in all forms of communication. Wise continues: “For the students that are not successful in the typical classroom, we offer a personalized route of taking classes online and preparing an individual plan. “Students can come here and work in the relaxed atmosphere with their learning coach, at their pace and comfort zone. “We offered a jumpstart on college that provided our students with up to 32 credit hours of college, while they are in high school.” What especially surprised me is the way the ILC builds student confidence by allowing the kids to share their rising skills, which can benefit other learners. Says Wise: “Students could also come here for authentic learning experiences such as our Career Mentorship program, which allows students to go out and mentor in a field of their choice during their class time.” Moreover, “Students interested in becoming an educator could participate in our Teacher Academy and do student teaching while in high school.” Also, “Students interested in entrepreneurship could participate in our business academy.” He emails quotes from students already immersed in the Independent Learning Center: “I get to learn as an individual and the teachers here are willing to work with you in the way that is best for you.” “I enjoy the freedom and ability to be treated as an adult.” “I feel as if there is a higher level of appreciation and respect for education on the parts of students and teachers. There’s also more respect for each other. We’re there for a common goal and also have a common understanding. We all WANT to be there — and that makes a world of difference.” And you may have noticed that the learning there is not most crucially measured by how these students do on collective standardized tests (and in preparing for those tests), which are still required in so many high schools throughout this land. Another quote from a student at the McVey Innovative Learning Center: “The best part of being a student at the ILC is gaining a whole new perspective on learning. I found it much more interesting and applicable to my future to learn concepts in an environment that doesn’t encourage you to be average. I also loved getting to meet people from three other high schools that I never would have met if it weren’t for this class.” And this brings us to how the McVey Innovative Learning Center actually operates. Wise emphasizes, “The ILC is NOT an alternative school. Students come here during their school day … for 90 minutes of their day; the rest of their day they are back at their home high schools.” Obviously, I cannot speak from any experience in having combined time at a regular high school with daily 90‐​minute periods at a contrasting, liberating environment, geared to help me discover what I most wanted for my future and how to get there. Years ago, Duke Ellington wrote a song that has since become a permanent part of me, as it keeps challenging me: Its title: “What Am I Here For?” During my six years at Boston Latin School, if I had been also part of an Innovative Learning Center in that city, I would have had a much clearer sense of what — and how — I needed to learn to keep answering that question of why I’m here. I did develop an unquenchable love of learning during those early years, but little of it from school. Most came from reading — on my own — histories, novels and biographies that raised my expectations of the kind of life I’d want to lead if I knew how. But if there had been an Innovative Learning Center in town, I might have experienced a much more inspiring road ahead. And I expect that may also be true of the futures of many young Americans, of all sorts of backgrounds, if each gets a personalized, expanding education.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/blog/did-citizens-united-critics-push-irs-misbehave\n2013-05-13\nLast Friday, a spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted the agency had targeted various Tea Party and related groups during the 2010 election cycle. Later in the week, an Inspector General’s report will offer an initial look at the facts of this matter. At least two congressional committees also plan investigations. Many people recall that the Nixon administration used the IRS to harass political opponents. Surely the IG’s report and subsequent investigations will show whether the IRS has gotten back into the business of protecting an incumbent administration from its critics. It is not too soon, however, to recall the the campaign finance reform lobby has been calling for a crackdown on political groups since the Citizens United decision. One possibility would be that the IRS gave in pressure from the reform lobby and went after the Tea Party groups. Was there an intention to chill speech? The timing provokes doubts: the targeting began in the spring of 2010 just as the mid‐​term campaign season started and ended after the election when the harassment no longer has any rationale. The long delays of approving tax status certainly slowed down the wave coming toward Congress in 2010. 66 House members lost their seats in that election. Do any sitting members owe their offices to the IRS? Even now, leading reform groups are calling for renewed crackdown on these groups. We are also told by more sober reformers that this whole matter shows the need for more disclosure and greater clarity in the rules. But the major argument against such disclosure has been that government officials will use the information to punish political opponents. Given what we know about this case, does it make sense to give the IRS more information about, and more power over groups that oppose the administration? Some will note the irony here. Most of campaign finance law was enacted in 1974 just after the end of the Watergate scandal. The campaign finance reform lobby dates its life to that scandal which, as noted, included using the IRS for political ends. Now the reformers are defending the IRS and its apparent political harassment. Things do seem to have come full circle.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.mercatus.org/economic-insights/expert-commentary/christmas-carol-do-gooders-dickensian-times\n2019-12-20\nOutside of the gospels, A Christmas Carol is probably the most famous Christmas story on earth. Dickens not only wrote a wildly imaginative story filled with wonderful characters, but he infused in it a plea for tolerance and generosity. Not surprisingly, when most people think of this timeless novella, they recall Charles Dickens’s reflections on Christmas spirit and the true meaning of the holiday. But this story can shed light on important economic principles as well. Purportedly written in a frenzied six weeks, A Christmas Carol was Dickens’s emotional response to the treatment of the poor. When reading this book (or almost anything by Dickens for that matter), the dismal socioeconomic landscape of England is vividly depicted. Indeed, in Dickens’s portrayals of the poor, particularly the urban poor, people are often living grim, gloomy, and destitute lives. What’s more, he expresses his discontent with treatment of the poor pointedly and without restraint, and for good reason. As the era of mass industry dawned in Europe and people migrated from rural areas to cities, the number of desperately poor and homeless people increased dramatically. It would have been bad enough if this new destitute class had merely been ignored. Instead, some of the government remedies to “fix” the problem ended up looking more like persecution of the poor. Noting the steep increase in the nation’s number of poor people, British government officials quickly enacted legislation to ease the public burden of poverty, the most prominent example being the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. This legislation claimed to assist the poor—at that time known by the charming Malthusian label of the “surplus population”—by funneling government relief into what were called “workhouses.” These establishments were notorious for conditions so undesirable that only the truly destitute would seek relief there, and as Dickens wrote in A Christmas Carol, “many would rather die” than endure them. The laws were intended to encourage poor people to stay off the streets and go out to find work, but it had no effect: because the workhouses were so unbearable, poor people decided they would rather be anyplace but there. The Poor Laws weren’t the only example of government regulation aggravating the problem. During Dickensian times, some bakeries would allow the poor to use their ovens on Sundays, since they were closed for the Sabbath. But legislation repeatedly targeted this practice in the name of preserving religious observance. Dickens invokes this in A Christmas Carol when the main character of the story, the literature’s most famous miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, speaks with the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge suggests that the spirit should prevent the poor from eating on the Sabbath, saying that the law prohibiting sharing ovens “has been done in your name.” The ghost responds in righteous anger at the implication and says that while there are some who pass laws like these “in our name,” Scrooge should “charge their doings on them, not us.” Not only does this demonstrate Dickens’s personal disdain for those who do morally reprehensible things in the name of religion, but it also shows the effect government overregulation has on those who try to help their less fortunate neighbors. This act of shutting down ovens seems counterproductive and even barbaric, but is it really that different than some government policies today? Consider the widespread prohibitions on providing food for homeless people. Many government regulations prevent people from providing poorer individuals with food, sometimes requiring licenses in the name of safety. In one ghastly case, Missouri health authorities went so far as to pour bleach on food meant for homeless individuals. Dickens would undoubtedly be appalled, but almost certainly not surprised. While this overregulation seems to be well-intentioned, it hurts poor people by removing their access to charity, and it thwarts those who want to help them. Perhaps the most important takeaway from A Christmas Carol is the underlying principle of voluntary charity. Government regulation may interfere with charitable acts, but through the transformation of Scrooge, Dickens shows that individuals have great power to improve the lives of others. Christmas is a reminder that are all charged to help one another and treat those in need as people, or as Dickens put it, “fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.” Christmastime should remind us that when government fails, it is the responsibility of individuals to help those in need.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/student-loan-default-crisis-borrowers-children/\n2017-11-15\nAttending college as a parent can be a daunting affair: It’s hard to find enough hours in the day for work, family, and school. Many institutions do not offer any child care and classes may only be available at inconvenient times. For many student-parents these stresses are too much to handle; only one-third of undergraduate parents finish a credential within six years of enrolling. Now, new data show another challenge for student-parents: repaying their federal loans. The analyses presented here show that almost half of student-parents who began college in the 2003-04 school year and borrowed a federal loan for their undergraduate education defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. That’s double the rate of borrowers without children. Even worse, 70 percent of student-parents who defaulted were single. For African Americans, single parents made up 90 percent of student-parent defaulters. As a result, 1 in 10 undergraduate borrowers was a single parent, but these students represented 2 out of every 5 undergraduate defaulters. For these borrowers, who are often the sole providers for the family, default can keep them entrenched in their current financial situations, making it all the more difficult to improve their circumstances. Student-parents are not a small subset of higher education enrollment. There are about 4.8 million undergraduates who are parents, 2.7 million of whom borrow to cover the costs of school. Students with children are disproportionately women of color, and most are enrolled at community and for-profit colleges. When these students borrow and default, they are thrust into a financial situation that is difficult to remedy. Combined with low completion rates, these figures demonstrate how much our higher education system struggles to serve those who need extra assistance. When student-parents don’t have access to comprehensive support systems, they suffer, both while enrolled and after. The federal government, states, and institutions must find ways to better address the needs of student-parents if the goal is to give them the opportunity to provide a better future for themselves and their families. The consequences of default Borrowers who default on their loans see their credit scores plummet, making it harder to take on additional debt, to rent or purchase a home, or to even get a job. The federal government can garnish wages and tax returns of defaulted borrowers, even if they are low-income. Defaulted borrowers also lose access to additional federal financial aid, which can compromise their ability to re-enroll in school. This is a big problem for student-parents who default, 54 percent of whom did not earn a credential. These consequences can compromise the ability of student-parents, particularly those who are single, to provide adequate resources and opportunities for their families. Lower default rates would allow more student-parents to experience the potential socioeconomic returns of a college education. Fewer defaults would also benefit the nation as a whole. Taxpayer dollars could be diverted to student outreach instead of being spent attempting to collect defaulted loans. Americans could also have confidence that our student loan system is built to serve students, even when they face difficult odds. Almost half of student-parents default on their loans Nearly half of students with children who entered college in 2004—46 percent—defaulted on their federal loans within 12 years. That’s 1.5 times the rate of all undergraduates and almost twice the rate of borrowers without children. As a result, students with children were only 17 percent of undergraduate borrowers but represented 27 percent of all undergraduate loan defaults Even though for-profit colleges enrolled 20 percent of all undergraduate borrowers, 60 percent of student-parents who defaulted started at these institutions. In fact, 44 percent of for-profit defaulters were parents, the highest share of any sector. That’s double the share of community colleges and 10 times the share of public, four-year institutions. These data fall in line with other research that shows that students who first enroll at for-profit colleges have higher default rates than other types of institutions. However, the default rates for student-parents at for-profits are disproportionately high compared to default rates for all borrowers, which could suggest that these colleges are not providing the resources student-parents need to succeed. Default rates are even worse for parents of young children Parents of young children particularly struggled to repay their loans. Fifty-three percent of students with children age 3 or younger defaulted, compared to 31 percent of parents with teenagers. This is perhaps because students with older children have fewer child care costs and obligations, which allows them to devote more time and resources to school. Again, students who enrolled at for-profit colleges had the worst outcomes. At these colleges, sixty-four percent of student-parents with young children defaulted on their loans within 12 years of enrolling. As a result, one-quarter of all undergraduate defaulters at for-profits had children age 3 or younger. The plight of single parents Perhaps most troubling is how many defaulted borrowers were single parents. Single parents make up two-thirds of student-parents who default, and account for 18 percent of all undergraduate defaults. High rates of default have important implications for these families. When students who have partners default, they are often able to lean on the credit and finances of the other parent to make ends meet as the former student resolves the default. However, for single parents, there may not be another adult who can support the family. This can keep single-parent families in dire economic circumstances for a much longer period, if they are ever able to get out. African Americans and Latinos make up 60 percent of defaulted single parents Undergraduates of color are more likely to have children than their white counterparts, and the data show that they are also a larger proportion of student-parents who default. African Americans and Latinos made up 52 percent of all student-parents (and 60 percent of all single parents) who defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. The default issue is particularly acute for single African American student-parents. Almost 90 percent of defaulted African American students with children were single. That share was 64 percent for Latino student-parents, 10 percentage points higher than for white student-parents. These data provide further evidence that single parents, especially those of color, should be a primary group of concern. CAP recently revealed the extent to which African American borrowers struggle to repay their student loans, and the analyses presented here provide further evidence that underrepresented students experience particularly poor outcomes. To confront these problems, the Department of Education must collect data on borrowers’ race to better understand these problems and develop effective solutions. What can be done to help borrowers with children? Parents who go to school seeking a better life for themselves and their children deserve better odds than a coin flip that they might default on their loans. The data show that the size of the loan balances of students with children are not the problem. Quite the opposite. Across all types of colleges, student-parents who defaulted had smaller balances than those who did not. This holds true for single parents as well as students who are raising children with a partner. Why are student-parents defaulting at such high rates? It is difficult to say without additional data, but the federal government, states, and institutions can take several steps to improve the educational experiences of these students, which can help keep them complete college and improve their repayment outcomes. On the repayment side, the federal government should examine whether student-parents are able to take advantage of plans that tie monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes. Unfortunately, the students included in these data enrolled six years* before Income-Based Repayment became available, which could partly explain these negative outcomes. However, more than 1 million borrowers default every year, raising questions as to whether students who would benefit from income-driven repayment options are using these plans. If they are not, the federal government should conduct additional research on default, and put together focus groups and other consumer testing to figure out why borrowers don’t use these plans. Policymakers can also do more to keep undergraduates with children from having to take on debt in the first place. The federal government and states should extend public assistance programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to more adults enrolled in college to help offset the costs of student-parents. States should be more supportive of these students by guaranteeing them state grant aid and extending promise—often called free college—initiatives beyond recent high school graduates. On the institutional side, free or subsidized child care, flexible course schedules, and opportunities to earn credit by assessing students’ current knowledge and skills can help reduce student-parents’ costs and the time they spend enrolled. If the aim of the America’s higher education system is to provide an escape from poverty and to spur the prosperity of those who have been historically marginalized, then ensuring that student-parents are able to successfully repay their debt is a must. Student-parents should be getting more from our higher education system, and policymakers have the power to improve their outcomes.

She won by just over two hundred votes in a race that went down to the wire. The outcome wasn’t determined until two days after the election, as mail-in ballots streamed in after election day. Six hundred ballots have been challenged and could still be counted, but they are not expected to change the recall’s outcome. Sawant won largely based on a concerted effort to get out the youth vote. Among all demographics, the eighteen to twenty-five cohort was the only one which increased its turnout from the most recent election, held only one month earlier. Three hundred more voters in that age group voted in this election compared to last month, and those three hundred were largely the margin of victory. To indicate the level of interest in the race: last month’s general election turnout was 43 percent. Turnout for the Sawant recall — a single-candidate special election — was 53 percent. Seattle’s capitalists have tried repeatedly to stamp out Sawant and her socialist politics from City Hall since her election in 2014. Repeatedly, they have failed. In 2013, Seattle voters elected Sawant for the first time. Since then, she has been the council’s most radical member. Though she has collaborated with fellow progressives on various legislative issues, Sawant is known for her take-no-prisoners style. She does not triangulate. She does not compromise for the sake of legislative success. She asserts her politics without fear. Though this makes her a target for conservative business interests who continually brand her as a dangerous extremist, it also earns her the passionate support of the city’s progressive voters. In celebrating the passage of a resolution taxing Amazon and other major companies in order to build low-income housing, she unabashedly confronted Jeff Bezos: We were clear-eyed about naming the real force pulling the strings: Amazon. Many argued that we should not “antagonize” big business and instead try to broker a deal, but we know that our power comes from working people getting organized, not from any negotiation with the elite. For those watching from outside Seattle, don’t let anyone tell you in your fight to tax big business in your city that you’re being divisive, because class struggle is what gets the goods. The private, for-profit housing market has utterly failed working people. Not just here and now, but everywhere and always. Because capitalism is completely incapable of meeting the most basic needs of working people. Internationally, the working class needs to take the top 500 corporations into democratic public ownership, run by workers, in the interests of human need and the environment, not billionaire greed. I have a message for Jeff Bezos and his class. If you attempt again to overturn the Amazon Tax, working people will go all out in the thousands to defeat you. And we will not stop there. Because you see, we are fighting for far more than this tax, we are preparing the ground for a different kind of society. And if you, Jeff Bezos, want to drive that process forward by lashing out against us in our modest demands, then so be it. Because we are coming for you and your rotten system. We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state. We cannot and will not stop until we overthrow it and replace it with a world based instead on solidarity, genuine democracy, and equality — a socialist world. She is an Indian immigrant who earned a degree in computer science at the University of Mumbai and began her career as a software engineer. She currently teaches economics at two local community colleges and is a leader of the Socialist Alternative. Sawant is a fiery speaker known for her speeches at local protests. She has championed several issues beloved by local progressives including demanding that local companies pay more in taxes to support housing for the homeless and education. Her local campaign for a $15 minimum wage helped build momentum for similar laws around the country. She has also championed renters’ rights and an eviction moratorium during the COVID epidemic. Sawant is unsparing and unrepentant in espousing her radical views. For that reason, she serves as a third rail in Seattle politics. Her colleagues may join with her on some issues, but they often steer clear in order to avoid the pushback the “radical socialist” receives. Landlords, real estate developers, and Big Tech routinely recruit candidates and donate large sums to unseat her. So far, they’ve failed in two previous elections. Last year, business decided to take a different tack. Since they could not defeat her in a general election, they decided to attempt a recall. They cleverly determined that scheduling the recall during a regular election would tend to increase turnout, which would not be to their advantage — from the anti-Sawant point of view, the fewer voters who showed up for the recall, the better. So they delayed registering their campaign in order to force a special election in which this single issue would be on the ballot. Anti-Sawant forces also raised over $1 million to fund TV commercials, glossy mailers and radio spots targeting her as a law-breaking extremist who would encourage mobs to attack City Hall and the homeless to take over the city stately neighborhoods. They even created a separate PAC enabling donors to give unlimited funds to support the recall. A Better Seattle raised $200,000 from its largely corporate donor base. To give a sense of how much money they spent: in the last election in which Sawant was reelected, the Chamber of Commerce PAC spent a then-unprecedented $1 million on all four of the council races (including Sawant’s). This time they spent that much just to defeat a single candidate: her. What the recall campaign had in well-heeled donors, the Sawant campaign made up for in committed small donors. And she matched her opponents virtually dollar for dollar. Despite Sawant’s victory, we should not expect the backlash threat of the corporate elite to decline. We saw this in the write-in campaign against Buffalo’s democratic socialist mayoral candidate, India Walton, which restored to office the Democratic machine mayor who’d lost the primary. Capital does not like losing, and it will retrench and return to the fray whenever left candidates like Sawant and Walton emerge. The victory over the Seattle recall takes some of the sting out of the defeat of progressive candidates for mayor and city attorney in November’s general election. It confirms that an avowedly progressive socialist message still resonates among Seattle voters. Those defeats were, in part, a backlash against last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, in which activists occupied the heart of the city’s Capitol Hill in June 2020. Two of the incidents emphasized by the recall proponents against Sawant were her participation in a march on City Hall, in which she used her key to open the building for the protesters. Separately, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter organized a march on Mayor Jenny Durkan’s home for which Sawant was blamed. Concurrent with the Capitol Hill occupation, the city’s corporate power structure was running a competing campaign portraying the city as “dying” due to crime, vandalism, and homeless encampments “invading” schools and neighborhoods. The city’s Sinclair Broadcasting affiliate, KOMO News, produced a special with the death-rattle title “Seattle Is Dying,” drawing national attention to these right-wing talking points. The TV evening news showed hundreds of stories of gang violence, shootings, and murders. They produced stories about fires, drug dealing, and murder at homeless encampments. The Seattle Times, owned for a hundred thirty years by a single wealthy Republican family, breathlessly hyped these developments on its news and editorial pages. During the year between the Capitol Hill occupation and the November election, the anti-homeless media campaign had a major impact. The city council, passed a 20 percent cut to the police department budget. But the mayoral candidate who ultimately won in the November election opposes any cut at all. By November, the enthusiasm and commitment which the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) had infused into Seattle had dissipated. That explains the electoral defeats mentioned earlier. The good news is that Sawant’s victory has arrested the momentum of the corporate elite. There will be no stampede to rid the city of its homeless population. The Left still has a strong voice in Seattle.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2016/dec/medicare-debate-intensify-democrats-draw-battle-lines\n2016-12-05\nBy Kerry Young, CQ Roll Call November 30, 2016 -- Republicans do not yet have a united approach on whether to push to make significant changes in Medicare. But Democrats are already pouncing on the opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of seniors and people with disabilities against Republicans who want to gut the entitlement program. \"\"It's clear that Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\"\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who will lead the chamber's Democrats next year, on Tuesday. Lawmakers may turn to a debate about the future of Medicare after Republicans take steps to partially repeal the 2010 health care law, which President-elect Donald Trump has set as a priority. House GOP aides are already working on legislative language for repeal. House Republicans have been pressing for years for a major shift in Medicare, with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., advocating for a move toward a defined contribution program. Under such a program, seniors would be given a set amount of money to shop for a Medicare plan. Critics say that if capped spending doesn't keep up with health care costs, seniors could suffer. Under GOP proposals, insurers would play a larger role than they already do in managing Medicare. Already, private Medicare Advantage plans cover roughly one of every three people enrolled in Medicare, which serves people who are 65 and older or who have significant disabilities. But some Senate Republicans don't appear as anxious as their House counterparts to jump into such a politically risky debate. Schumer already is predicting that GOP efforts to further privatize Medicare will falter, as did their plans for Social Security after their 2004 electoral victory. Some Medicare changes may fall outside what can easily be handled through the fast-track legislative mechanism that House Republicans are eyeing to quickly undo parts of the 2010 health care law, said Joseph Antos, a researcher with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The rules for using so-called budget reconciliation allow measures to proceed with simple majorities in the Senate and thus avoid filibusters, but the tool can only be used in limited circumstances. Rules named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., narrow the number of items to be included in a reconciliation bill to those with the clearest connection to changes in federal spending and revenue. \"\"All that is so complex and time-consuming that Medicare will have to wait, at least in terms of big decisions,\"\" Antos told CQ Roll Call. \"\"The big push will probably not be in 2017 unless there is a grand package of reforms\"\" that sweeps in Medicare and Medicaid, the joint federal–state health program for low-income people. Senate Republicans Reluctant Some Senate Republicans don't expect Congress to tackle a Medicare debate next year and say that it would not happen as part of the repeal of the 2010 health care law. \"\"My impression is that everyone would see [the health law] repeal as an issue in and of itself. It may have some Medicaid components, but I doubt that it has many Medicare components,\"\" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., told CQ Roll Call. Moran also said he's concerned that House lawmakers will eye Medicare as a source of savings to be used for other purposes. \"\"My view is that any changes in Medicare would be designed to strengthen and improve Medicare, and it should not be a source for funding other things,\"\" he said. Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Tuesday he doesn't think that changes to Medicare should be part of next year's repeal effort. \"\"I think that falls under the rule of not biting off more than you can chew,\"\" the Tennessee Republican told reporters. \"\"One of the Democrats' big problems with Obamacare was they tried to do too much, too fast. I think the problems about the solvency of Medicare should be left for another debate, another discussion.\"\" Sen. Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is one of a handful of Democrats who say they would oppose Trump's nomination of House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services due to his support for plans to alter Medicare. \"\"The nomination vote on Tom Price is the first test of whether Congress is prepared to stand up to the Republicans' clear desire to end Medicare as we know it,\"\" Murphy said in a statement. Still, some Senate Republicans are anxious for a broad discussion of changes to the so-called entitlement programs that rest at the heart of the nation's budget woes. \"\"The big deal that we've got to do is going to have to include Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,\"\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. Flake said he expected this work would have to wait until after completion of the effort to partially repeal the 2010 health care law. \"\"It's tough to see how it all fits in. It's a packed schedule, so I'd be surprised to see a serious discussion of Medicare in the months ahead,\"\" he said. In contrast, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said it's possible that a broader conversation about changes to Medicare could emerge in the Obamacare repeal debate. \"\"It will be a part of the conversation,\"\" Isakson said. \"\"Everything is going to be open for grabs.\"\"\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/article/miscalculating-tunisia\n2021-07-28\nOn July 25, Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the country’s prime minister and suspended parliament for 30 days. Security forces were then deployed around the parliament building in Tunis, blocking legislators from passing through. The next day, the president forced out the acting justice minister, sacked the defense minister, and ordered the offices of Al Jazeera closed. He also banned gatherings of three people or more. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Rached Ghannouchi, the speaker of the now shuttered parliament and longtime leader of the Islamist Ennahdha party, called Saied’s action a “coup.” The president disagreed, citing Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which gives the head of state the power to do precisely what he did in the event of “imminent danger threatening the integrity of the country and the country’s security and independence.” There is a significant difference of opinion, however, as to whether Tunisia’s current dire economic problems, parliamentary drift, and a debilitating wave of COVID-19 actually amount to such imminent danger. This would seem to be a problem that the Constitutional Court could adjudicate—but alas, there is no court because either no one can agree on which judges to appoint or the president has blocked their appointment. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy Coup or no coup, this was not supposed to happen in Tunisia. Tunisia is (or was) the “lone success story” of the Arab Spring. But these kinds of clichés, used by international media over and over for a decade, were themselves always a problem. They framed Tunisian politics in a way that closed off other possibilities—like backsliding—and envisaged linear developments from protests to elections to a constitution. When breathless editorials described a peaceful transfer of power to a “genuine democracy,” they stripped out the complexity of Tunisian politics specifically and transitions to democracy more generally.

Tunisians have been on the brink before, including during an extended political stalemate in 2013. Then, in 2015, newly elected President Beji Caid Essebsi preferred a government that would have excluded Ennahdha and its allies. Unfortunately for Essebsi and the secularists of his Nidaa Tounes party, the parliamentary math did not work in his favor, forcing a broader coalition. Goodwill eventually developed between the president and Ghannouchi, but what seemed more important than personality in forcing a compromise was the very fact that neither Essebsi nor Ghannouchi had the kind of popular support necessary to impose his will on the other—an apparent benefit of a divided society. It was laudable and notable that Tunisia did not descend into violence in 2013, that a workable coalition government was established in 2015, and that there was a peaceful transfer of power after Essebsi died in 2019––though none of these achievements necessarily meant that Tunisia was going to continue to progress. Serious analysts knew this because they understood the country’s economic challenges, the lingering questions around identity, the yen for the old order among elites, and the inability of parliament to make good on the promise of the January 2011 revolution. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Yet curiously, some of these same experts and observers continued to describe Tunisia straightforwardly as a success—creating an unwritten and unacknowledged expectation that the country’s progress would invariably continue. This was especially odd, given the ongoing erosion in the past decade of democratic institutions in countries considered consolidated democracies––including the United States. In the few days since Saied gave himself executive authority, there have been protests both in support and opposition to his actions. The former are more interesting. Dispatches from Tunisia indicate that those hailing the president have had enough of poor governance and a lack of economic opportunity. Layer into these problems the fact that a recent wave of COVID-19 has devastated the country’s health care system, and a lot more people seem willing to bet on an authoritarian who promises to make their lives better with more unencumbered power at his disposal. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy The readiness to part with hard-won gains after a decade of democratization seems to be part and parcel of Tunisia’s particular political culture. No, I’m not referring to the canard that Arab and Muslim societies are unpracticed at democracy; rather, I mean to draw attention to the cultural legacy of the big Arab state that promised (but rarely, if ever, delivered) security, education, and opportunity. The analysts, journalists, and civil society activists with whom Westerners tend to interact in Tunisia want to forge a more just and democratic society. But what about Tunisians more broadly? Many—or at least the ones in the streets in the last few days—seem to have a more ambivalent relationship with democracy. They seem to want a more effective state that can deliver jobs and a social safety net regardless of the character of the political system. It is possible that after a decade in which Tunisians enjoyed greater personal freedoms, the lack of prosperity has made a potentially significant number of them more willing to give some version of authoritarianism another try. Of course, it remains entirely unclear what will happen in Tunisia and what foreign powers can do about it. Given how much attention the press and experts have lavished on Tunisia since the overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, combined with U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to a values-based foreign policy, there will be at least some pressure for the United States to respond. Yet here is the conundrum: In Washington, Tunisia tends to be viewed through the prism of its presumed success. Thus, experts and activists have advocated for providing more assistance to Tunisia precisely because it is alleged to have made the transition to democracy. The United States has also developed a security relationship with Tunisia based on fighting extremism. Should the United States now withhold or cut this aid? That would seem appropriate in terms of values but perhaps risky when it comes to security, given Tunisia’s penchant for producing extremists and instability in the neighboring Sahel region. This is not an easy circle to square. In what would be one of the more unexpected developments in U.S. Middle East policy, Tunisia may end up being a cautionary tale in building a policy around a regime type because political systems can change—quickly.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.demos.org/blog/one-job-too-many-ceo-shouldnt-also-be-chairman\n2013-05-14\nWith Jamie Dimon under growing fire from shareholders of JP Morgan Chase, one possibility is that he may relinquish his role as chairman of the board but remain as CEO. That raises an interesting question: Why does Dimon hold both jobs to begin with? The answer is that it's common practice at many corporations for the CEO to also be chair, known as \"\"duality.\"\" Surveys have found that CEOs also hold the chair position in the majority of large corporations. But why is that? After all, isn't the job of a board to supervise the CEO and organization as a whole -- or at least closely monitor things? In fact it is. So who came up with idea of having the CEO also lead the body that is supposed to be his or her boss? Arguments for duality rest, in part, on the idea that it is more efficient and effective to have one person fully in charge. And anyone who has ever seen the president and the board chair of an organization end up at odds knows that there is something to this logic. But the conflicts of interest inherent in duality would seem to militate clearly in favor of dividing these jobs. I mean, doesn't anyone remember the scandals of the Enron era, where you had imperial CEOs like Bernard Ebbers of Worldcom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco driving their companies into the ground? Don't people remember the way that CEOs packed boards -- and especially board compensation and audit committees -- with cronies that wrote them a blank check at shareholder expense? Come to think of it, forget all that ancient history. What about all the imperial bank CEOs-Chairmen, like Merrill's Stanley O'Neal, who led their firms to gorge on toxic assets without any real supervision? A key takeaway of all these scandals is that boards needed to be more independent, and the good news is that both regulatory changes and voluntarily corporate actions have reduced the pervasiveness of duality over the past decade. But this bad idea lives on, as we see at JP Morgan and many other companies. In some countries, duality is illegal. That should be the case here. One footnote: duality is very rare in the nonprofit sector. The president of Princeton University isn't also chair of its board of trustees. The president of Ford isn't wielding the gavel at the foundation's board meetings. Maybe there are nonprofits where the CEO and chair jobs are combined, but I don't know of any.\nleft-wing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Sample Data"

He was unpopular even then. At the end of January, he was about five points behind Joe Biden in national polls, which also showed that a small majority of the country disapproved of his job performance. But his numbers had been improving, and he had three great assets going into a campaign year. First, his party was unified in support of him. Unlike every incumbent president who had lost an election since the Great Depression, he had avoided a serious primary challenge. Trump has sided with Republican voters on the issues that large numbers of them care deeply about, from guns to taxes to the courts. That record, and the fact that Democrats are on the other side of those issues, has kept Republican voters with him. Their support has in turn kept Republican politicians in line. The Democrats’ impeachment and attempted removal of Trump from office — remember that? — only strengthened Republicans’ commitment to him. Second, the economy was strong. Democrats were in denial about it, but both economic statistics and public-opinion surveys agreed. Third, the president’s opposition was moving further to the left of public opinion. Several of the Democratic presidential candidates came out for outlawing the private health insurance on which most Americans rely. Republican strategists could hardly believe their luck as a self-described “democratic socialist,” Senator Bernie Sanders, got the most votes in the first three Democratic contests. It all changed rapidly, starting in March. Democratic voters who don’t consider themselves “very liberal” consolidated behind Biden, and clinched the nomination for him. Biden’s victory made it much harder for Trump to base his campaign on fear of left-wing extremism. “He’s not radical Left,” Trump himself has conceded. That same month, the president declared Covid-19 a national emergency, and much of the country shut down. The unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, jumped to 14.7% by April. Trump can argue that the economy is improving, or say that the pre-Covid record vindicates his economic policies. But he no longer has at his disposal the clean case that times are good — which would surely have been a major theme of this convention week if we still had the economy of the start of the year. Trump is down to his first asset, a solid base of support. He continues to do a lot to keep it. When former President Barack Obama delivered a tough critique of him at last week’s Democratic convention, Trump tweeted in response that Obama had spied on him. It’s the sort of riposte that appeals to people already in his corner. But that base won’t be enough for Trump to win re-election, or for his party to avoid losses down ballot. It wasn’t enough in 2016, even with a coalition that was efficiently distributed among the states for electoral power: About a fifth of his voters were people who disapproved of him. And building on his base will now be far harder than it looked in February. At the start of the year, there was a plausible strategy: Convince enough people who didn’t like Trump that they should vote for him anyway, because he had delivered positive results and the opposition was too risky. Now he has to win over people who don’t like him when the economy is weak, close to 200,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the opposition is led by someone who beat a socialist. Republicans have been saying that the Democratic convention was too grim in its depiction of American life and that their own convention will be upbeat. They will surely try to lift Trump’s approval ratings this week. But they may find bringing Biden’s numbers down is more feasible. Trump and other Republicans have already made several attacks on Biden. They may continue to say age has diminished him too much for him to be able to do the job of president, a criticism that plays into the Democrat’s hands by making it easier for him to look competent. They will surely press the argument that the Democrats are too far left, and that Biden will enable rather than restrain them. That strategy attempts to make the election a referendum, not on Trump or even Biden, but on the Democratic Party. The task for Republicans this week is thus clearly defined, if difficult to execute: Persuade some of those voters who don’t approve of how Trump has performed as president that they should fear the Democrats more.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/nyc-primary-votes-really-matter-4248.html\n2013-09-10\nAre you so depressed about the mayoral race you’re thinking about staying away from the polls? Think again. Things are bad. But they could — and can — be worse. Whether you’re a Democratic or Republican, your vote matters — and your vote tomorrow matters more than your vote Nov. 5. New Yorkers may think that their vote doesn’t matter. After all, the Quinnipiac poll shows Public Advocate Bill de Blasio beating his closest competitor two-to-one, and at 43 percent — above the 40 percent he needs to avoid a runoff election with the next top vote-getter. And observers see this lead as solid. Top rivals Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson aren’t doing anything wrong, campaign-wise — so can’t fix the problem. Thompson already ran for mayor and lost — and served as city comptroller, too. Quinn’s been City Council speaker for eight years. John Lindsay’s old motto when voters elected him nearly half a century ago — “He is fresh and everyone else is tired” — fits de Blasio. Then, too, you may think there’s no real policy difference among the Democratic candidates. (That is, they’re uniformly awful.) But even if you’re a liberal, the thought of a de Blasio landslide should make you nervous. The candidate said proudly last week that his tax hike on the rich was the “centerpiece” of his campaign. So the entire reason he’s running is to increase city tax revenues by 1 percent. With solid economic growth, de Blasio could do that easily without hiking taxes. His tax hike isn’t a fiscally responsible way of paying for your new spending. It’s suicidal liberalism for the sake of liberalism. New York needs another three weeks’ worth of a more pragmatic Democrat — either Thompson or Quinn would do fine — pointing out that this is insane. Democrats who really don’t want to be forced to vote for a Republican in two months’ time should think about this now, not then. That said, Republican votes may matter Tuesday more than Democratic ones. Political consultants and “business community” observers terrified of a de Blasio mayor are complacent. They think former MTA chief and Giuliani sidekick Joe Lhota is a shoo-in. He’s got 48 percent of the vote, says Quinnipiac, way more than he needs to avoid a runoff. Plus, Lhota is the guy with experience running a massive transit system, the city’s budget and much of the city’s day-to-day operations. Over him, who on earth would vote for John Catsimatidis — the laughingstock frumpy, slightly nutty-sounding supermarket billionaire whose main idea is a new World’s Fair? Don’t be so sure. “We ain’t never been here before,” says veteran pollster John Zogby, who’s not polling for any candidate in this race. “Catsimatidis is wild, and he’s a wild card.” Why? New York hasn’t had a real contested Republican mayoral primary since 2001, when Herman Badillo ran against Bloomberg. Badillo, the underdog, lost (obviously), solidifying the conventional wisdom that underdogs lose this race. But we’ve never had a race where the underdog — Catsimatidis — was the one spending all the money. “Does the GOP primary matter? Of course it does,” notes Zogby. That’s partly because the general election may be “a hell of a lot more competitive than it may look.” Who voters pick now — on both sides — matters. Catsimatidis has blitzed airwaves and mailboxes for weeks. He’s hitting Lhota where it hurts. Mostly he’s attacking Lhota for raising bridge tolls while he was at the MTA. As a policy matter, this charge is absurd: Catsimatidis won’t say how he would’ve avoided a toll hike. But GOP voters are outer-boroughites who care fiercely about taxes — and they drive. What about the poll? Quinnipiac is a fine outfit. But the number of Republicans it polled is barely in the hundreds. Pollsters have no idea who or how many will vote, or why. With only 45,000 city Republicans having voted in the last contested state-wide primary, all the answers matter. Do the city’s small, mysterious band of Republicans like Rudy Giuliani (who’s endorsed Lhota) more than they hate higher tolls? If you’d like to spend the fall debating reasonable NYPD reforms and fair solutions to the city’s budget crisis rather than discussing whether we should abolish stop, question and frisk or run over kitty-cats, your chance to make a difference is now — not two months down the line. This piece originally appeared in New York Post\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/commentary/personalized-education-while-changing-places-learning\n2014-06-18\nHe currently presides at the McVey Innovative Learning Center (ILC), named for former Hilliard City Schools Superintendent Dale McVey. As I have long believed, Wise argues that schools should no longer take “a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all approach.” And he explains via email, “Four years ago, a group of Hilliard City School educators came together to develop a plan for what (high) schools should look and feel like (here) in the year 2020.” The genesis of the ILC, he says, came from educators’ desire “for a design of a high school of the future. One that personalizes education for each student in a way that allows them to pursue their passion.” Last fall, the ILC opened its doors to more than 800 students. “This next fall,” Wise says, “we have had over 1,200 requests to come to the Innovative Learning Center.” Wise, who is a former classroom teacher, describes the diverse adventures in learning at the ILC: “We have talented music students … so we offer a sound engineering course … Students learn how to make professional recordings while writing and performing their own music. “For the students interested in the world of television journalism and movie production, we offer courses that allow for creative production.” I’m already fantasizing. At my public high school, Boston Latin School, I would have rushed into a course on reporting — with guest professional journalists — in all forms of communication. Wise continues: “For the students that are not successful in the typical classroom, we offer a personalized route of taking classes online and preparing an individual plan. “Students can come here and work in the relaxed atmosphere with their learning coach, at their pace and comfort zone. “We offered a jumpstart on college that provided our students with up to 32 credit hours of college, while they are in high school.” What especially surprised me is the way the ILC builds student confidence by allowing the kids to share their rising skills, which can benefit other learners. Says Wise: “Students could also come here for authentic learning experiences such as our Career Mentorship program, which allows students to go out and mentor in a field of their choice during their class time.” Moreover, “Students interested in becoming an educator could participate in our Teacher Academy and do student teaching while in high school.” Also, “Students interested in entrepreneurship could participate in our business academy.” He emails quotes from students already immersed in the Independent Learning Center: “I get to learn as an individual and the teachers here are willing to work with you in the way that is best for you.” “I enjoy the freedom and ability to be treated as an adult.” “I feel as if there is a higher level of appreciation and respect for education on the parts of students and teachers. There’s also more respect for each other. We’re there for a common goal and also have a common understanding. We all WANT to be there — and that makes a world of difference.” And you may have noticed that the learning there is not most crucially measured by how these students do on collective standardized tests (and in preparing for those tests), which are still required in so many high schools throughout this land. Another quote from a student at the McVey Innovative Learning Center: “The best part of being a student at the ILC is gaining a whole new perspective on learning. I found it much more interesting and applicable to my future to learn concepts in an environment that doesn’t encourage you to be average. I also loved getting to meet people from three other high schools that I never would have met if it weren’t for this class.” And this brings us to how the McVey Innovative Learning Center actually operates. Wise emphasizes, “The ILC is NOT an alternative school. Students come here during their school day … for 90 minutes of their day; the rest of their day they are back at their home high schools.” Obviously, I cannot speak from any experience in having combined time at a regular high school with daily 90‐​minute periods at a contrasting, liberating environment, geared to help me discover what I most wanted for my future and how to get there. Years ago, Duke Ellington wrote a song that has since become a permanent part of me, as it keeps challenging me: Its title: “What Am I Here For?” During my six years at Boston Latin School, if I had been also part of an Innovative Learning Center in that city, I would have had a much clearer sense of what — and how — I needed to learn to keep answering that question of why I’m here. I did develop an unquenchable love of learning during those early years, but little of it from school. Most came from reading — on my own — histories, novels and biographies that raised my expectations of the kind of life I’d want to lead if I knew how. But if there had been an Innovative Learning Center in town, I might have experienced a much more inspiring road ahead. And I expect that may also be true of the futures of many young Americans, of all sorts of backgrounds, if each gets a personalized, expanding education.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/blog/did-citizens-united-critics-push-irs-misbehave\n2013-05-13\nLast Friday, a spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted the agency had targeted various Tea Party and related groups during the 2010 election cycle. Later in the week, an Inspector General’s report will offer an initial look at the facts of this matter. At least two congressional committees also plan investigations. Many people recall that the Nixon administration used the IRS to harass political opponents. Surely the IG’s report and subsequent investigations will show whether the IRS has gotten back into the business of protecting an incumbent administration from its critics. It is not too soon, however, to recall the the campaign finance reform lobby has been calling for a crackdown on political groups since the Citizens United decision. One possibility would be that the IRS gave in pressure from the reform lobby and went after the Tea Party groups. Was there an intention to chill speech? The timing provokes doubts: the targeting began in the spring of 2010 just as the mid‐​term campaign season started and ended after the election when the harassment no longer has any rationale. The long delays of approving tax status certainly slowed down the wave coming toward Congress in 2010. 66 House members lost their seats in that election. Do any sitting members owe their offices to the IRS? Even now, leading reform groups are calling for renewed crackdown on these groups. We are also told by more sober reformers that this whole matter shows the need for more disclosure and greater clarity in the rules. But the major argument against such disclosure has been that government officials will use the information to punish political opponents. Given what we know about this case, does it make sense to give the IRS more information about, and more power over groups that oppose the administration? Some will note the irony here. Most of campaign finance law was enacted in 1974 just after the end of the Watergate scandal. The campaign finance reform lobby dates its life to that scandal which, as noted, included using the IRS for political ends. Now the reformers are defending the IRS and its apparent political harassment. Things do seem to have come full circle.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.mercatus.org/economic-insights/expert-commentary/christmas-carol-do-gooders-dickensian-times\n2019-12-20\nOutside of the gospels, A Christmas Carol is probably the most famous Christmas story on earth. Dickens not only wrote a wildly imaginative story filled with wonderful characters, but he infused in it a plea for tolerance and generosity. Not surprisingly, when most people think of this timeless novella, they recall Charles Dickens’s reflections on Christmas spirit and the true meaning of the holiday. But this story can shed light on important economic principles as well. Purportedly written in a frenzied six weeks, A Christmas Carol was Dickens’s emotional response to the treatment of the poor. When reading this book (or almost anything by Dickens for that matter), the dismal socioeconomic landscape of England is vividly depicted. Indeed, in Dickens’s portrayals of the poor, particularly the urban poor, people are often living grim, gloomy, and destitute lives. What’s more, he expresses his discontent with treatment of the poor pointedly and without restraint, and for good reason. As the era of mass industry dawned in Europe and people migrated from rural areas to cities, the number of desperately poor and homeless people increased dramatically. It would have been bad enough if this new destitute class had merely been ignored. Instead, some of the government remedies to “fix” the problem ended up looking more like persecution of the poor. Noting the steep increase in the nation’s number of poor people, British government officials quickly enacted legislation to ease the public burden of poverty, the most prominent example being the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. This legislation claimed to assist the poor—at that time known by the charming Malthusian label of the “surplus population”—by funneling government relief into what were called “workhouses.” These establishments were notorious for conditions so undesirable that only the truly destitute would seek relief there, and as Dickens wrote in A Christmas Carol, “many would rather die” than endure them. The laws were intended to encourage poor people to stay off the streets and go out to find work, but it had no effect: because the workhouses were so unbearable, poor people decided they would rather be anyplace but there. The Poor Laws weren’t the only example of government regulation aggravating the problem. During Dickensian times, some bakeries would allow the poor to use their ovens on Sundays, since they were closed for the Sabbath. But legislation repeatedly targeted this practice in the name of preserving religious observance. Dickens invokes this in A Christmas Carol when the main character of the story, the literature’s most famous miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, speaks with the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge suggests that the spirit should prevent the poor from eating on the Sabbath, saying that the law prohibiting sharing ovens “has been done in your name.” The ghost responds in righteous anger at the implication and says that while there are some who pass laws like these “in our name,” Scrooge should “charge their doings on them, not us.” Not only does this demonstrate Dickens’s personal disdain for those who do morally reprehensible things in the name of religion, but it also shows the effect government overregulation has on those who try to help their less fortunate neighbors. This act of shutting down ovens seems counterproductive and even barbaric, but is it really that different than some government policies today? Consider the widespread prohibitions on providing food for homeless people. Many government regulations prevent people from providing poorer individuals with food, sometimes requiring licenses in the name of safety. In one ghastly case, Missouri health authorities went so far as to pour bleach on food meant for homeless individuals. Dickens would undoubtedly be appalled, but almost certainly not surprised. While this overregulation seems to be well-intentioned, it hurts poor people by removing their access to charity, and it thwarts those who want to help them. Perhaps the most important takeaway from A Christmas Carol is the underlying principle of voluntary charity. Government regulation may interfere with charitable acts, but through the transformation of Scrooge, Dickens shows that individuals have great power to improve the lives of others. Christmas is a reminder that are all charged to help one another and treat those in need as people, or as Dickens put it, “fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.” Christmastime should remind us that when government fails, it is the responsibility of individuals to help those in need.\nright-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/student-loan-default-crisis-borrowers-children/\n2017-11-15\nAttending college as a parent can be a daunting affair: It’s hard to find enough hours in the day for work, family, and school. Many institutions do not offer any child care and classes may only be available at inconvenient times. For many student-parents these stresses are too much to handle; only one-third of undergraduate parents finish a credential within six years of enrolling. Now, new data show another challenge for student-parents: repaying their federal loans. The analyses presented here show that almost half of student-parents who began college in the 2003-04 school year and borrowed a federal loan for their undergraduate education defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. That’s double the rate of borrowers without children. Even worse, 70 percent of student-parents who defaulted were single. For African Americans, single parents made up 90 percent of student-parent defaulters. As a result, 1 in 10 undergraduate borrowers was a single parent, but these students represented 2 out of every 5 undergraduate defaulters. For these borrowers, who are often the sole providers for the family, default can keep them entrenched in their current financial situations, making it all the more difficult to improve their circumstances. Student-parents are not a small subset of higher education enrollment. There are about 4.8 million undergraduates who are parents, 2.7 million of whom borrow to cover the costs of school. Students with children are disproportionately women of color, and most are enrolled at community and for-profit colleges. When these students borrow and default, they are thrust into a financial situation that is difficult to remedy. Combined with low completion rates, these figures demonstrate how much our higher education system struggles to serve those who need extra assistance. When student-parents don’t have access to comprehensive support systems, they suffer, both while enrolled and after. The federal government, states, and institutions must find ways to better address the needs of student-parents if the goal is to give them the opportunity to provide a better future for themselves and their families. The consequences of default Borrowers who default on their loans see their credit scores plummet, making it harder to take on additional debt, to rent or purchase a home, or to even get a job. The federal government can garnish wages and tax returns of defaulted borrowers, even if they are low-income. Defaulted borrowers also lose access to additional federal financial aid, which can compromise their ability to re-enroll in school. This is a big problem for student-parents who default, 54 percent of whom did not earn a credential. These consequences can compromise the ability of student-parents, particularly those who are single, to provide adequate resources and opportunities for their families. Lower default rates would allow more student-parents to experience the potential socioeconomic returns of a college education. Fewer defaults would also benefit the nation as a whole. Taxpayer dollars could be diverted to student outreach instead of being spent attempting to collect defaulted loans. Americans could also have confidence that our student loan system is built to serve students, even when they face difficult odds. Almost half of student-parents default on their loans Nearly half of students with children who entered college in 2004—46 percent—defaulted on their federal loans within 12 years. That’s 1.5 times the rate of all undergraduates and almost twice the rate of borrowers without children. As a result, students with children were only 17 percent of undergraduate borrowers but represented 27 percent of all undergraduate loan defaults Even though for-profit colleges enrolled 20 percent of all undergraduate borrowers, 60 percent of student-parents who defaulted started at these institutions. In fact, 44 percent of for-profit defaulters were parents, the highest share of any sector. That’s double the share of community colleges and 10 times the share of public, four-year institutions. These data fall in line with other research that shows that students who first enroll at for-profit colleges have higher default rates than other types of institutions. However, the default rates for student-parents at for-profits are disproportionately high compared to default rates for all borrowers, which could suggest that these colleges are not providing the resources student-parents need to succeed. Default rates are even worse for parents of young children Parents of young children particularly struggled to repay their loans. Fifty-three percent of students with children age 3 or younger defaulted, compared to 31 percent of parents with teenagers. This is perhaps because students with older children have fewer child care costs and obligations, which allows them to devote more time and resources to school. Again, students who enrolled at for-profit colleges had the worst outcomes. At these colleges, sixty-four percent of student-parents with young children defaulted on their loans within 12 years of enrolling. As a result, one-quarter of all undergraduate defaulters at for-profits had children age 3 or younger. The plight of single parents Perhaps most troubling is how many defaulted borrowers were single parents. Single parents make up two-thirds of student-parents who default, and account for 18 percent of all undergraduate defaults. High rates of default have important implications for these families. When students who have partners default, they are often able to lean on the credit and finances of the other parent to make ends meet as the former student resolves the default. However, for single parents, there may not be another adult who can support the family. This can keep single-parent families in dire economic circumstances for a much longer period, if they are ever able to get out. African Americans and Latinos make up 60 percent of defaulted single parents Undergraduates of color are more likely to have children than their white counterparts, and the data show that they are also a larger proportion of student-parents who default. African Americans and Latinos made up 52 percent of all student-parents (and 60 percent of all single parents) who defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. The default issue is particularly acute for single African American student-parents. Almost 90 percent of defaulted African American students with children were single. That share was 64 percent for Latino student-parents, 10 percentage points higher than for white student-parents. These data provide further evidence that single parents, especially those of color, should be a primary group of concern. CAP recently revealed the extent to which African American borrowers struggle to repay their student loans, and the analyses presented here provide further evidence that underrepresented students experience particularly poor outcomes. To confront these problems, the Department of Education must collect data on borrowers’ race to better understand these problems and develop effective solutions. What can be done to help borrowers with children? Parents who go to school seeking a better life for themselves and their children deserve better odds than a coin flip that they might default on their loans. The data show that the size of the loan balances of students with children are not the problem. Quite the opposite. Across all types of colleges, student-parents who defaulted had smaller balances than those who did not. This holds true for single parents as well as students who are raising children with a partner. Why are student-parents defaulting at such high rates? It is difficult to say without additional data, but the federal government, states, and institutions can take several steps to improve the educational experiences of these students, which can help keep them complete college and improve their repayment outcomes. On the repayment side, the federal government should examine whether student-parents are able to take advantage of plans that tie monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes. Unfortunately, the students included in these data enrolled six years* before Income-Based Repayment became available, which could partly explain these negative outcomes. However, more than 1 million borrowers default every year, raising questions as to whether students who would benefit from income-driven repayment options are using these plans. If they are not, the federal government should conduct additional research on default, and put together focus groups and other consumer testing to figure out why borrowers don’t use these plans. Policymakers can also do more to keep undergraduates with children from having to take on debt in the first place. The federal government and states should extend public assistance programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to more adults enrolled in college to help offset the costs of student-parents. States should be more supportive of these students by guaranteeing them state grant aid and extending promise—often called free college—initiatives beyond recent high school graduates. On the institutional side, free or subsidized child care, flexible course schedules, and opportunities to earn credit by assessing students’ current knowledge and skills can help reduce student-parents’ costs and the time they spend enrolled. If the aim of the America’s higher education system is to provide an escape from poverty and to spur the prosperity of those who have been historically marginalized, then ensuring that student-parents are able to successfully repay their debt is a must. Student-parents should be getting more from our higher education system, and policymakers have the power to improve their outcomes.

She won by just over two hundred votes in a race that went down to the wire. The outcome wasn’t determined until two days after the election, as mail-in ballots streamed in after election day. Six hundred ballots have been challenged and could still be counted, but they are not expected to change the recall’s outcome. Sawant won largely based on a concerted effort to get out the youth vote. Among all demographics, the eighteen to twenty-five cohort was the only one which increased its turnout from the most recent election, held only one month earlier. Three hundred more voters in that age group voted in this election compared to last month, and those three hundred were largely the margin of victory. To indicate the level of interest in the race: last month’s general election turnout was 43 percent. Turnout for the Sawant recall — a single-candidate special election — was 53 percent. Seattle’s capitalists have tried repeatedly to stamp out Sawant and her socialist politics from City Hall since her election in 2014. Repeatedly, they have failed. In 2013, Seattle voters elected Sawant for the first time. Since then, she has been the council’s most radical member. Though she has collaborated with fellow progressives on various legislative issues, Sawant is known for her take-no-prisoners style. She does not triangulate. She does not compromise for the sake of legislative success. She asserts her politics without fear. Though this makes her a target for conservative business interests who continually brand her as a dangerous extremist, it also earns her the passionate support of the city’s progressive voters. In celebrating the passage of a resolution taxing Amazon and other major companies in order to build low-income housing, she unabashedly confronted Jeff Bezos: We were clear-eyed about naming the real force pulling the strings: Amazon. Many argued that we should not “antagonize” big business and instead try to broker a deal, but we know that our power comes from working people getting organized, not from any negotiation with the elite. For those watching from outside Seattle, don’t let anyone tell you in your fight to tax big business in your city that you’re being divisive, because class struggle is what gets the goods. The private, for-profit housing market has utterly failed working people. Not just here and now, but everywhere and always. Because capitalism is completely incapable of meeting the most basic needs of working people. Internationally, the working class needs to take the top 500 corporations into democratic public ownership, run by workers, in the interests of human need and the environment, not billionaire greed. I have a message for Jeff Bezos and his class. If you attempt again to overturn the Amazon Tax, working people will go all out in the thousands to defeat you. And we will not stop there. Because you see, we are fighting for far more than this tax, we are preparing the ground for a different kind of society. And if you, Jeff Bezos, want to drive that process forward by lashing out against us in our modest demands, then so be it. Because we are coming for you and your rotten system. We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state. We cannot and will not stop until we overthrow it and replace it with a world based instead on solidarity, genuine democracy, and equality — a socialist world. She is an Indian immigrant who earned a degree in computer science at the University of Mumbai and began her career as a software engineer. She currently teaches economics at two local community colleges and is a leader of the Socialist Alternative. Sawant is a fiery speaker known for her speeches at local protests. She has championed several issues beloved by local progressives including demanding that local companies pay more in taxes to support housing for the homeless and education. Her local campaign for a $15 minimum wage helped build momentum for similar laws around the country. She has also championed renters’ rights and an eviction moratorium during the COVID epidemic. Sawant is unsparing and unrepentant in espousing her radical views. For that reason, she serves as a third rail in Seattle politics. Her colleagues may join with her on some issues, but they often steer clear in order to avoid the pushback the “radical socialist” receives. Landlords, real estate developers, and Big Tech routinely recruit candidates and donate large sums to unseat her. So far, they’ve failed in two previous elections. Last year, business decided to take a different tack. Since they could not defeat her in a general election, they decided to attempt a recall. They cleverly determined that scheduling the recall during a regular election would tend to increase turnout, which would not be to their advantage — from the anti-Sawant point of view, the fewer voters who showed up for the recall, the better. So they delayed registering their campaign in order to force a special election in which this single issue would be on the ballot. Anti-Sawant forces also raised over $1 million to fund TV commercials, glossy mailers and radio spots targeting her as a law-breaking extremist who would encourage mobs to attack City Hall and the homeless to take over the city stately neighborhoods. They even created a separate PAC enabling donors to give unlimited funds to support the recall. A Better Seattle raised $200,000 from its largely corporate donor base. To give a sense of how much money they spent: in the last election in which Sawant was reelected, the Chamber of Commerce PAC spent a then-unprecedented $1 million on all four of the council races (including Sawant’s). This time they spent that much just to defeat a single candidate: her. What the recall campaign had in well-heeled donors, the Sawant campaign made up for in committed small donors. And she matched her opponents virtually dollar for dollar. Despite Sawant’s victory, we should not expect the backlash threat of the corporate elite to decline. We saw this in the write-in campaign against Buffalo’s democratic socialist mayoral candidate, India Walton, which restored to office the Democratic machine mayor who’d lost the primary. Capital does not like losing, and it will retrench and return to the fray whenever left candidates like Sawant and Walton emerge. The victory over the Seattle recall takes some of the sting out of the defeat of progressive candidates for mayor and city attorney in November’s general election. It confirms that an avowedly progressive socialist message still resonates among Seattle voters. Those defeats were, in part, a backlash against last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, in which activists occupied the heart of the city’s Capitol Hill in June 2020. Two of the incidents emphasized by the recall proponents against Sawant were her participation in a march on City Hall, in which she used her key to open the building for the protesters. Separately, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter organized a march on Mayor Jenny Durkan’s home for which Sawant was blamed. Concurrent with the Capitol Hill occupation, the city’s corporate power structure was running a competing campaign portraying the city as “dying” due to crime, vandalism, and homeless encampments “invading” schools and neighborhoods. The city’s Sinclair Broadcasting affiliate, KOMO News, produced a special with the death-rattle title “Seattle Is Dying,” drawing national attention to these right-wing talking points. The TV evening news showed hundreds of stories of gang violence, shootings, and murders. They produced stories about fires, drug dealing, and murder at homeless encampments. The Seattle Times, owned for a hundred thirty years by a single wealthy Republican family, breathlessly hyped these developments on its news and editorial pages. During the year between the Capitol Hill occupation and the November election, the anti-homeless media campaign had a major impact. The city council, passed a 20 percent cut to the police department budget. But the mayoral candidate who ultimately won in the November election opposes any cut at all. By November, the enthusiasm and commitment which the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) had infused into Seattle had dissipated. That explains the electoral defeats mentioned earlier. The good news is that Sawant’s victory has arrested the momentum of the corporate elite. There will be no stampede to rid the city of its homeless population. The Left still has a strong voice in Seattle.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2016/dec/medicare-debate-intensify-democrats-draw-battle-lines\n2016-12-05\nBy Kerry Young, CQ Roll Call November 30, 2016 -- Republicans do not yet have a united approach on whether to push to make significant changes in Medicare. But Democrats are already pouncing on the opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of seniors and people with disabilities against Republicans who want to gut the entitlement program. \"\"It's clear that Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\"\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who will lead the chamber's Democrats next year, on Tuesday. Lawmakers may turn to a debate about the future of Medicare after Republicans take steps to partially repeal the 2010 health care law, which President-elect Donald Trump has set as a priority. House GOP aides are already working on legislative language for repeal. House Republicans have been pressing for years for a major shift in Medicare, with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., advocating for a move toward a defined contribution program. Under such a program, seniors would be given a set amount of money to shop for a Medicare plan. Critics say that if capped spending doesn't keep up with health care costs, seniors could suffer. Under GOP proposals, insurers would play a larger role than they already do in managing Medicare. Already, private Medicare Advantage plans cover roughly one of every three people enrolled in Medicare, which serves people who are 65 and older or who have significant disabilities. But some Senate Republicans don't appear as anxious as their House counterparts to jump into such a politically risky debate. Schumer already is predicting that GOP efforts to further privatize Medicare will falter, as did their plans for Social Security after their 2004 electoral victory. Some Medicare changes may fall outside what can easily be handled through the fast-track legislative mechanism that House Republicans are eyeing to quickly undo parts of the 2010 health care law, said Joseph Antos, a researcher with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The rules for using so-called budget reconciliation allow measures to proceed with simple majorities in the Senate and thus avoid filibusters, but the tool can only be used in limited circumstances. Rules named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., narrow the number of items to be included in a reconciliation bill to those with the clearest connection to changes in federal spending and revenue. \"\"All that is so complex and time-consuming that Medicare will have to wait, at least in terms of big decisions,\"\" Antos told CQ Roll Call. \"\"The big push will probably not be in 2017 unless there is a grand package of reforms\"\" that sweeps in Medicare and Medicaid, the joint federal–state health program for low-income people. Senate Republicans Reluctant Some Senate Republicans don't expect Congress to tackle a Medicare debate next year and say that it would not happen as part of the repeal of the 2010 health care law. \"\"My impression is that everyone would see [the health law] repeal as an issue in and of itself. It may have some Medicaid components, but I doubt that it has many Medicare components,\"\" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., told CQ Roll Call. Moran also said he's concerned that House lawmakers will eye Medicare as a source of savings to be used for other purposes. \"\"My view is that any changes in Medicare would be designed to strengthen and improve Medicare, and it should not be a source for funding other things,\"\" he said. Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Tuesday he doesn't think that changes to Medicare should be part of next year's repeal effort. \"\"I think that falls under the rule of not biting off more than you can chew,\"\" the Tennessee Republican told reporters. \"\"One of the Democrats' big problems with Obamacare was they tried to do too much, too fast. I think the problems about the solvency of Medicare should be left for another debate, another discussion.\"\" Sen. Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is one of a handful of Democrats who say they would oppose Trump's nomination of House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services due to his support for plans to alter Medicare. \"\"The nomination vote on Tom Price is the first test of whether Congress is prepared to stand up to the Republicans' clear desire to end Medicare as we know it,\"\" Murphy said in a statement. Still, some Senate Republicans are anxious for a broad discussion of changes to the so-called entitlement programs that rest at the heart of the nation's budget woes. \"\"The big deal that we've got to do is going to have to include Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,\"\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. Flake said he expected this work would have to wait until after completion of the effort to partially repeal the 2010 health care law. \"\"It's tough to see how it all fits in. It's a packed schedule, so I'd be surprised to see a serious discussion of Medicare in the months ahead,\"\" he said. In contrast, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said it's possible that a broader conversation about changes to Medicare could emerge in the Obamacare repeal debate. \"\"It will be a part of the conversation,\"\" Isakson said. \"\"Everything is going to be open for grabs.\"\"\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/article/miscalculating-tunisia\n2021-07-28\nOn July 25, Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the country’s prime minister and suspended parliament for 30 days. Security forces were then deployed around the parliament building in Tunis, blocking legislators from passing through. The next day, the president forced out the acting justice minister, sacked the defense minister, and ordered the offices of Al Jazeera closed. He also banned gatherings of three people or more. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Rached Ghannouchi, the speaker of the now shuttered parliament and longtime leader of the Islamist Ennahdha party, called Saied’s action a “coup.” The president disagreed, citing Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which gives the head of state the power to do precisely what he did in the event of “imminent danger threatening the integrity of the country and the country’s security and independence.” There is a significant difference of opinion, however, as to whether Tunisia’s current dire economic problems, parliamentary drift, and a debilitating wave of COVID-19 actually amount to such imminent danger. This would seem to be a problem that the Constitutional Court could adjudicate—but alas, there is no court because either no one can agree on which judges to appoint or the president has blocked their appointment. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy Coup or no coup, this was not supposed to happen in Tunisia. Tunisia is (or was) the “lone success story” of the Arab Spring. But these kinds of clichés, used by international media over and over for a decade, were themselves always a problem. They framed Tunisian politics in a way that closed off other possibilities—like backsliding—and envisaged linear developments from protests to elections to a constitution. When breathless editorials described a peaceful transfer of power to a “genuine democracy,” they stripped out the complexity of Tunisian politics specifically and transitions to democracy more generally.

Tunisians have been on the brink before, including during an extended political stalemate in 2013. Then, in 2015, newly elected President Beji Caid Essebsi preferred a government that would have excluded Ennahdha and its allies. Unfortunately for Essebsi and the secularists of his Nidaa Tounes party, the parliamentary math did not work in his favor, forcing a broader coalition. Goodwill eventually developed between the president and Ghannouchi, but what seemed more important than personality in forcing a compromise was the very fact that neither Essebsi nor Ghannouchi had the kind of popular support necessary to impose his will on the other—an apparent benefit of a divided society. It was laudable and notable that Tunisia did not descend into violence in 2013, that a workable coalition government was established in 2015, and that there was a peaceful transfer of power after Essebsi died in 2019––though none of these achievements necessarily meant that Tunisia was going to continue to progress. Serious analysts knew this because they understood the country’s economic challenges, the lingering questions around identity, the yen for the old order among elites, and the inability of parliament to make good on the promise of the January 2011 revolution. More From Our Experts Elliott Abrams Israel's Crisis Steven A. Cook Twenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy Henri J. Barkey Erdoğan Is In Danger Yet curiously, some of these same experts and observers continued to describe Tunisia straightforwardly as a success—creating an unwritten and unacknowledged expectation that the country’s progress would invariably continue. This was especially odd, given the ongoing erosion in the past decade of democratic institutions in countries considered consolidated democracies––including the United States. In the few days since Saied gave himself executive authority, there have been protests both in support and opposition to his actions. The former are more interesting. Dispatches from Tunisia indicate that those hailing the president have had enough of poor governance and a lack of economic opportunity. Layer into these problems the fact that a recent wave of COVID-19 has devastated the country’s health care system, and a lot more people seem willing to bet on an authoritarian who promises to make their lives better with more unencumbered power at his disposal. More on: Middle East and North Africa Tunisia Democracy The readiness to part with hard-won gains after a decade of democratization seems to be part and parcel of Tunisia’s particular political culture. No, I’m not referring to the canard that Arab and Muslim societies are unpracticed at democracy; rather, I mean to draw attention to the cultural legacy of the big Arab state that promised (but rarely, if ever, delivered) security, education, and opportunity. The analysts, journalists, and civil society activists with whom Westerners tend to interact in Tunisia want to forge a more just and democratic society. But what about Tunisians more broadly? Many—or at least the ones in the streets in the last few days—seem to have a more ambivalent relationship with democracy. They seem to want a more effective state that can deliver jobs and a social safety net regardless of the character of the political system. It is possible that after a decade in which Tunisians enjoyed greater personal freedoms, the lack of prosperity has made a potentially significant number of them more willing to give some version of authoritarianism another try. Of course, it remains entirely unclear what will happen in Tunisia and what foreign powers can do about it. Given how much attention the press and experts have lavished on Tunisia since the overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, combined with U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to a values-based foreign policy, there will be at least some pressure for the United States to respond. Yet here is the conundrum: In Washington, Tunisia tends to be viewed through the prism of its presumed success. Thus, experts and activists have advocated for providing more assistance to Tunisia precisely because it is alleged to have made the transition to democracy. The United States has also developed a security relationship with Tunisia based on fighting extremism. Should the United States now withhold or cut this aid? That would seem appropriate in terms of values but perhaps risky when it comes to security, given Tunisia’s penchant for producing extremists and instability in the neighboring Sahel region. This is not an easy circle to square. In what would be one of the more unexpected developments in U.S. Middle East policy, Tunisia may end up being a cautionary tale in building a policy around a regime type because political systems can change—quickly.\nleft-wing\n\n\nhttps://www.demos.org/blog/one-job-too-many-ceo-shouldnt-also-be-chairman\n2013-05-14\nWith Jamie Dimon under growing fire from shareholders of JP Morgan Chase, one possibility is that he may relinquish his role as chairman of the board but remain as CEO. That raises an interesting question: Why does Dimon hold both jobs to begin with? The answer is that it's common practice at many corporations for the CEO to also be chair, known as \"\"duality.\"\" Surveys have found that CEOs also hold the chair position in the majority of large corporations. But why is that? After all, isn't the job of a board to supervise the CEO and organization as a whole -- or at least closely monitor things? In fact it is. So who came up with idea of having the CEO also lead the body that is supposed to be his or her boss? Arguments for duality rest, in part, on the idea that it is more efficient and effective to have one person fully in charge. And anyone who has ever seen the president and the board chair of an organization end up at odds knows that there is something to this logic. But the conflicts of interest inherent in duality would seem to militate clearly in favor of dividing these jobs. I mean, doesn't anyone remember the scandals of the Enron era, where you had imperial CEOs like Bernard Ebbers of Worldcom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco driving their companies into the ground? Don't people remember the way that CEOs packed boards -- and especially board compensation and audit committees -- with cronies that wrote them a blank check at shareholder expense? Come to think of it, forget all that ancient history. What about all the imperial bank CEOs-Chairmen, like Merrill's Stanley O'Neal, who led their firms to gorge on toxic assets without any real supervision? A key takeaway of all these scandals is that boards needed to be more independent, and the good news is that both regulatory changes and voluntarily corporate actions have reduced the pervasiveness of duality over the past decade. But this bad idea lives on, as we see at JP Morgan and many other companies. In some countries, duality is illegal. That should be the case here. One footnote: duality is very rare in the nonprofit sector. The president of Princeton University isn't also chair of its board of trustees. The president of Ford isn't wielding the gavel at the foundation's board meetings. Maybe there are nonprofits where the CEO and chair jobs are combined, but I don't know of any.\nleft-wing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Sample Data"

At the end of January, he was about five points behind Joe Biden in national polls, which also showed that a small majority of the country disapproved of his job performance. But his numbers had been improving, and he had three great assets going into a campaign year.\n\nFirst, his party was unified in support of him. Unlike every incumbent president who had lost an election since the Great Depression, he had avoided a serious primary challenge. Trump has sided with Republican voters on the issues that large numbers of them care deeply about, from guns to taxes to the courts. That record, and the fact that Democrats are on the other side of those issues, has kept Republican voters with him. Their support has in turn kept Republican politicians in line. The Democrats’ impeachment and attempted removal of Trump from office — remember that? — only strengthened Republicans’ commitment to him.\n\nSecond, the economy was strong. Democrats were in denial about it, but both economic statistics and public-opinion surveys agreed.\n\nThird, the president’s opposition was moving further to the left of public opinion. Several of the Democratic presidential candidates came out for outlawing the private health insurance on which most Americans rely. Republican strategists could hardly believe their luck as a self-described “democratic socialist,” Senator Bernie Sanders, got the most votes in the first three Democratic contests.\n\nIt all changed rapidly, starting in March. Democratic voters who don’t consider themselves “very liberal” consolidated behind Biden, and clinched the nomination for him. Biden’s victory made it much harder for Trump to base his campaign on fear of left-wing extremism. “He’s not radical Left,” Trump himself has conceded.\n\nThat same month, the president declared Covid-19 a national emergency, and much of the country shut down. The unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, jumped to 14.7% by April. Trump can argue that the economy is improving, or say that the pre-Covid record vindicates his economic policies. But he no longer has at his disposal the clean case that times are good — which would surely have been a major theme of this convention week if we still had the economy of the start of the year.\n\nTrump is down to his first asset, a solid base of support. He continues to do a lot to keep it. When former President Barack Obama delivered a tough critique of him at last week’s Democratic convention, Trump tweeted in response that Obama had spied on him. It’s the sort of riposte that appeals to people already in his corner.\n\nBut that base won’t be enough for Trump to win re-election, or for his party to avoid losses down ballot. It wasn’t enough in 2016, even with a coalition that was efficiently distributed among the states for electoral power: About a fifth of his voters were people who disapproved of him. And building on his base will now be far harder than it looked in February.\n\nAt the start of the year, there was a plausible strategy: Convince enough people who didn’t like Trump that they should vote for him anyway, because he had delivered positive results and the opposition was too risky. Now he has to win over people who don’t like him when the economy is weak, close to 200,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the opposition is led by someone who beat a socialist.\n\nRepublicans have been saying that the Democratic convention was too grim in its depiction of American life and that their own convention will be upbeat. They will surely try to lift Trump’s approval ratings this week. But they may find bringing Biden’s numbers down is more feasible.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have already made several attacks on Biden. They may continue to say age has diminished him too much for him to be able to do the job of president, a criticism that plays into the Democrat’s hands by making it easier for him to look competent. They will surely press the argument that the Democrats are too far left, and that Biden will enable rather than restrain them. That strategy attempts to make the election a referendum, not on Trump or even Biden, but on the Democratic Party.\n\nThe task for Republicans this week is thus clearly defined, if difficult to execute: Persuade some of those voters who don’t approve of how Trump has performed as president that they should fear the Democrats more.\nright-wing\n    https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/nyc-primary-votes-really-matter-4248.html\n2013-09-10\nAre you so depressed about the mayoral race you’re thinking about staying away from the polls? Think again. Things are bad. But they could — and can — be worse. Whether you’re a Democratic or Republican, your vote matters — and your vote tomorrow matters more than your vote Nov. 5.\n\nNew Yorkers may think that their vote doesn’t matter.\n\nAfter all, the Quinnipiac poll shows Public Advocate Bill de Blasio beating his closest competitor two-to-one, and at 43 percent — above the 40 percent he needs to avoid a runoff election with the next top vote-getter. And observers see this lead as solid.\n\nTop rivals Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson aren’t doing anything wrong, campaign-wise — so can’t fix the problem. Thompson already ran for mayor and lost — and served as city comptroller, too. Quinn’s been City Council speaker for eight years.\n\nJohn Lindsay’s old motto when voters elected him nearly half a century ago — “He is fresh and everyone else is tired” — fits de Blasio.\n\nThen, too, you may think there’s no real policy difference among the Democratic candidates. (That is, they’re uniformly awful.)\n\nBut even if you’re a liberal, the thought of a de Blasio landslide should make you nervous. The candidate said proudly last week that his tax hike on the rich was the “centerpiece” of his campaign. So the entire reason he’s running is to increase city tax revenues by 1 percent.\n\nWith solid economic growth, de Blasio could do that easily without hiking taxes. His tax hike isn’t a fiscally responsible way of paying for your new spending. It’s suicidal liberalism for the sake of liberalism.\n\nNew York needs another three weeks’ worth of a more pragmatic Democrat — either Thompson or Quinn would do fine — pointing out that this is insane.\n\nDemocrats who really don’t want to be forced to vote for a Republican in two months’ time should think about this now, not then.\n\nThat said, Republican votes may matter Tuesday more than Democratic ones.\n\nPolitical consultants and “business community” observers terrified of a de Blasio mayor are complacent. They think former MTA chief and Giuliani sidekick Joe Lhota is a shoo-in.\n\nHe’s got 48 percent of the vote, says Quinnipiac, way more than he needs to avoid a runoff.\n\nPlus, Lhota is the guy with experience running a massive transit system, the city’s budget and much of the city’s day-to-day operations. Over him, who on earth would vote for John Catsimatidis — the laughingstock frumpy, slightly nutty-sounding supermarket billionaire whose main idea is a new World’s Fair?\n\nDon’t be so sure. “We ain’t never been here before,” says veteran pollster John Zogby, who’s not polling for any candidate in this race. “Catsimatidis is wild, and he’s a wild card.”\n\nWhy? New York hasn’t had a real contested Republican mayoral primary since 2001, when Herman Badillo ran against Bloomberg.\n\nBadillo, the underdog, lost (obviously), solidifying the conventional wisdom that underdogs lose this race. But we’ve never had a race where the underdog — Catsimatidis — was the one spending all the money.\n\n“Does the GOP primary matter? Of course it does,” notes Zogby. That’s partly because the general election may be “a hell of a lot more competitive than it may look.” Who voters pick now — on both sides — matters.\n\nCatsimatidis has blitzed airwaves and mailboxes for weeks. He’s hitting Lhota where it hurts.\n\nMostly he’s attacking Lhota for raising bridge tolls while he was at the MTA. As a policy matter, this charge is absurd: Catsimatidis won’t say how he would’ve avoided a toll hike.\n\nBut GOP voters are outer-boroughites who care fiercely about taxes — and they drive.\n\nWhat about the poll? Quinnipiac is a fine outfit. But the number of Republicans it polled is barely in the hundreds. Pollsters have no idea who or how many will vote, or why.\n\nWith only 45,000 city Republicans having voted in the last contested state-wide primary, all the answers matter.\n\nDo the city’s small, mysterious band of Republicans like Rudy Giuliani (who’s endorsed Lhota) more than they hate higher tolls?\n\nIf you’d like to spend the fall debating reasonable NYPD reforms and fair solutions to the city’s budget crisis rather than discussing whether we should abolish stop, question and frisk or run over kitty-cats, your chance to make a difference is now — not two months down the line.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in New York Post\nright-wing\n    https://www.cato.org/commentary/personalized-education-while-changing-places-learning\n2014-06-18\nHe currently presides at the McVey Innovative Learning Center (ILC), named for former Hilliard City Schools Superintendent Dale McVey.\n\nAs I have long believed, Wise argues that schools should no longer take “a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all approach.”\n\nAnd he explains via email, “Four years ago, a group of Hilliard City School educators came together to develop a plan for what (high) schools should look and feel like (here) in the year 2020.”\n\nThe genesis of the ILC, he says, came from educators’ desire “for a design of a high school of the future. One that personalizes education for each student in a way that allows them to pursue their passion.”\n\nLast fall, the ILC opened its doors to more than 800 students.\n\n“This next fall,” Wise says, “we have had over 1,200 requests to come to the Innovative Learning Center.”\n\nWise, who is a former classroom teacher, describes the diverse adventures in learning at the ILC:\n\n“We have talented music students … so we offer a sound engineering course … Students learn how to make professional recordings while writing and performing their own music.\n\n“For the students interested in the world of television journalism and movie production, we offer courses that allow for creative production.”\n\nI’m already fantasizing. At my public high school, Boston Latin School, I would have rushed into a course on reporting — with guest professional journalists — in all forms of communication.\n\nWise continues: “For the students that are not successful in the typical classroom, we offer a personalized route of taking classes online and preparing an individual plan.\n\n“Students can come here and work in the relaxed atmosphere with their learning coach, at their pace and comfort zone.\n\n“We offered a jumpstart on college that provided our students with up to 32 credit hours of college, while they are in high school.”\n\nWhat especially surprised me is the way the ILC builds student confidence by allowing the kids to share their rising skills, which can benefit other learners.\n\nSays Wise: “Students could also come here for authentic learning experiences such as our Career Mentorship program, which allows students to go out and mentor in a field of their choice during their class time.”\n\nMoreover, “Students interested in becoming an educator could participate in our Teacher Academy and do student teaching while in high school.”\n\nAlso, “Students interested in entrepreneurship could participate in our business academy.”\n\nHe emails quotes from students already immersed in the Independent Learning Center:\n\n“I get to learn as an individual and the teachers here are willing to work with you in the way that is best for you.”\n\n“I enjoy the freedom and ability to be treated as an adult.”\n\n“I feel as if there is a higher level of appreciation and respect for education on the parts of students and teachers. There’s also more respect for each other. We’re there for a common goal and also have a common understanding. We all WANT to be there — and that makes a world of difference.”\n\nAnd you may have noticed that the learning there is not most crucially measured by how these students do on collective standardized tests (and in preparing for those tests), which are still required in so many high schools throughout this land.\n\nAnother quote from a student at the McVey Innovative Learning Center: “The best part of being a student at the ILC is gaining a whole new perspective on learning. I found it much more interesting and applicable to my future to learn concepts in an environment that doesn’t encourage you to be average. I also loved getting to meet people from three other high schools that I never would have met if it weren’t for this class.”\n\nAnd this brings us to how the McVey Innovative Learning Center actually operates. Wise emphasizes, “The ILC is NOT an alternative school. Students come here during their school day … for 90 minutes of their day; the rest of their day they are back at their home high schools.”\n\nObviously, I cannot speak from any experience in having combined time at a regular high school with daily 90‐​minute periods at a contrasting, liberating environment, geared to help me discover what I most wanted for my future and how to get there.\n\nYears ago, Duke Ellington wrote a song that has since become a permanent part of me, as it keeps challenging me:\n\nIts title: “What Am I Here For?”\n\nDuring my six years at Boston Latin School, if I had been also part of an Innovative Learning Center in that city, I would have had a much clearer sense of what — and how — I needed to learn to keep answering that question of why I’m here.\n\nI did develop an unquenchable love of learning during those early years, but little of it from school. Most came from reading — on my own — histories, novels and biographies that raised my expectations of the kind of life I’d want to lead if I knew how.\n\nBut if there had been an Innovative Learning Center in town, I might have experienced a much more inspiring road ahead. And I expect that may also be true of the futures of many young Americans, of all sorts of backgrounds, if each gets a personalized, expanding education.\nright-wing\n    https://www.cato.org/blog/did-citizens-united-critics-push-irs-misbehave\n2013-05-13\nLast Friday, a spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted the agency had targeted various Tea Party and related groups during the 2010 election cycle. Later in the week, an Inspector General’s report will offer an initial look at the facts of this matter. At least two congressional committees also plan investigations.\n\n\nMany people recall that the Nixon administration used the IRS to harass political opponents. Surely the IG’s report and subsequent investigations will show whether the IRS has gotten back into the business of protecting an incumbent administration from its critics.\n\n\nIt is not too soon, however, to recall the the campaign finance reform lobby has been calling for a crackdown on political groups since the Citizens United decision. One possibility would be that the IRS gave in pressure from the reform lobby and went after the Tea Party groups.\n\n\nWas there an intention to chill speech? The timing provokes doubts: the targeting began in the spring of 2010 just as the mid‐​term campaign season started and ended after the election when the harassment no longer has any rationale. The long delays of approving tax status certainly slowed down the wave coming toward Congress in 2010. 66 House members lost their seats in that election. Do any sitting members owe their offices to the IRS?\n\n\nEven now, leading reform groups are calling for renewed crackdown on these groups. We are also told by more sober reformers that this whole matter shows the need for more disclosure and greater clarity in the rules. But the major argument against such disclosure has been that government officials will use the information to punish political opponents. Given what we know about this case, does it make sense to give the IRS more information about, and more power over groups that oppose the administration?\n\n\nSome will note the irony here. Most of campaign finance law was enacted in 1974 just after the end of the Watergate scandal. The campaign finance reform lobby dates its life to that scandal which, as noted, included using the IRS for political ends. Now the reformers are defending the IRS and its apparent political harassment. Things do seem to have come full circle.\nright-wing\n    https://www.mercatus.org/economic-insights/expert-commentary/christmas-carol-do-gooders-dickensian-times\n2019-12-20\nOutside of the gospels, A Christmas Carol is probably the most famous Christmas story on earth. Dickens not only wrote a wildly imaginative story filled with wonderful characters, but he infused in it a plea for tolerance and generosity.\n\nNot surprisingly, when most people think of this timeless novella, they recall Charles Dickens’s reflections on Christmas spirit and the true meaning of the holiday. But this story can shed light on important economic principles as well.\n\nPurportedly written in a frenzied six weeks, A Christmas Carol was Dickens’s emotional response to the treatment of the poor. When reading this book (or almost anything by Dickens for that matter), the dismal socioeconomic landscape of England is vividly depicted. Indeed, in Dickens’s portrayals of the poor, particularly the urban poor, people are often living grim, gloomy, and destitute lives. What’s more, he expresses his discontent with treatment of the poor pointedly and without restraint, and for good reason.\n\nAs the era of mass industry dawned in Europe and people migrated from rural areas to cities, the number of desperately poor and homeless people increased dramatically. It would have been bad enough if this new destitute class had merely been ignored. Instead, some of the government remedies to “fix” the problem ended up looking more like persecution of the poor.\n\nNoting the steep increase in the nation’s number of poor people, British government officials quickly enacted legislation to ease the public burden of poverty, the most prominent example being the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. This legislation claimed to assist the poor—at that time known by the charming Malthusian label of the “surplus population”—by funneling government relief into what were called “workhouses.”\n\nThese establishments were notorious for conditions so undesirable that only the truly destitute would seek relief there, and as Dickens wrote in A Christmas Carol, “many would rather die” than endure them. The laws were intended to encourage poor people to stay off the streets and go out to find work, but it had no effect: because the workhouses were so unbearable, poor people decided they would rather be anyplace but there.\n\nThe Poor Laws weren’t the only example of government regulation aggravating the problem. During Dickensian times, some bakeries would allow the poor to use their ovens on Sundays, since they were closed for the Sabbath. But legislation repeatedly targeted this practice in the name of preserving religious observance.\n\nDickens invokes this in A Christmas Carol when the main character of the story, the literature’s most famous miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, speaks with the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge suggests that the spirit should prevent the poor from eating on the Sabbath, saying that the law prohibiting sharing ovens “has been done in your name.” The ghost responds in righteous anger at the implication and says that while there are some who pass laws like these “in our name,” Scrooge should “charge their doings on them, not us.”\n\nNot only does this demonstrate Dickens’s personal disdain for those who do morally reprehensible things in the name of religion, but it also shows the effect government overregulation has on those who try to help their less fortunate neighbors.\n\nThis act of shutting down ovens seems counterproductive and even barbaric, but is it really that different than some government policies today? Consider the widespread prohibitions on providing food for homeless people. Many government regulations prevent people from providing poorer individuals with food, sometimes requiring licenses in the name of safety. In one ghastly case, Missouri health authorities went so far as to pour bleach on food meant for homeless individuals. Dickens would undoubtedly be appalled, but almost certainly not surprised.\n\nWhile this overregulation seems to be well-intentioned, it hurts poor people by removing their access to charity, and it thwarts those who want to help them.\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway from A Christmas Carol is the underlying principle of voluntary charity. Government regulation may interfere with charitable acts, but through the transformation of Scrooge, Dickens shows that individuals have great power to improve the lives of others.\n\nChristmas is a reminder that are all charged to help one another and treat those in need as people, or as Dickens put it, “fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.” Christmastime should remind us that when government fails, it is the responsibility of individuals to help those in need.\nright-wing\n    https://www.americanprogress.org/article/student-loan-default-crisis-borrowers-children/\n2017-11-15\nAttending college as a parent can be a daunting affair: It’s hard to find enough hours in the day for work, family, and school. Many institutions do not offer any child care and classes may only be available at inconvenient times. For many student-parents these stresses are too much to handle; only one-third of undergraduate parents finish a credential within six years of enrolling.\n\nNow, new data show another challenge for student-parents: repaying their federal loans. The analyses presented here show that almost half of student-parents who began college in the 2003-04 school year and borrowed a federal loan for their undergraduate education defaulted within 12 years of enrolling. That’s double the rate of borrowers without children.\n\nEven worse, 70 percent of student-parents who defaulted were single. For African Americans, single parents made up 90 percent of student-parent defaulters. As a result, 1 in 10 undergraduate borrowers was a single parent, but these students represented 2 out of every 5 undergraduate defaulters. For these borrowers, who are often the sole providers for the family, default can keep them entrenched in their current financial situations, making it all the more difficult to improve their circumstances.\n\nStudent-parents are not a small subset of higher education enrollment. There are about 4.8 million undergraduates who are parents, 2.7 million of whom borrow to cover the costs of school. Students with children are disproportionately women of color, and most are enrolled at community and for-profit colleges. When these students borrow and default, they are thrust into a financial situation that is difficult to remedy.\n\nCombined with low completion rates, these figures demonstrate how much our higher education system struggles to serve those who need extra assistance. When student-parents don’t have access to comprehensive support systems, they suffer, both while enrolled and after. The federal government, states, and institutions must find ways to better address the needs of student-parents if the goal is to give them the opportunity to provide a better future for themselves and their families.\n\nThe consequences of default\n\nBorrowers who default on their loans see their credit scores plummet, making it harder to take on additional debt, to rent or purchase a home, or to even get a job. The federal government can garnish wages and tax returns of defaulted borrowers, even if they are low-income. Defaulted borrowers also lose access to additional federal financial aid, which can compromise their ability to re-enroll in school. This is a big problem for student-parents who default, 54 percent of whom did not earn a credential. These consequences can compromise the ability of student-parents, particularly those who are single, to provide adequate resources and opportunities for their families.\n\nLower default rates would allow more student-parents to experience the potential socioeconomic returns of a college education. Fewer defaults would also benefit the nation as a whole. Taxpayer dollars could be diverted to student outreach instead of being spent attempting to collect defaulted loans. Americans could also have confidence that our student loan system is built to serve students, even when they face difficult odds.\n\nAlmost half of student-parents default on their loans\n\nNearly half of students with children who entered college in 2004—46 percent—defaulted on their federal loans within 12 years. That’s 1.5 times the rate of all undergraduates and almost twice the rate of borrowers without children. As a result, students with children were only 17 percent of undergraduate borrowers but represented 27 percent of all undergraduate loan defaults\n\nEven though for-profit colleges enrolled 20 percent of all undergraduate borrowers, 60 percent of student-parents who defaulted started at these institutions. In fact, 44 percent of for-profit defaulters were parents, the highest share of any sector. That’s double the share of community colleges and 10 times the share of public, four-year institutions. These data fall in line with other research that shows that students who first enroll at for-profit colleges have higher default rates than other types of institutions. However, the default rates for student-parents at for-profits are disproportionately high compared to default rates for all borrowers, which could suggest that these colleges are not providing the resources student-parents need to succeed.\n\nDefault rates are even worse for parents of young children\n\nParents of young children particularly struggled to repay their loans. Fifty-three percent of students with children age 3 or younger defaulted, compared to 31 percent of parents with teenagers. This is perhaps because students with older children have fewer child care costs and obligations, which allows them to devote more time and resources to school.\n\nAgain, students who enrolled at for-profit colleges had the worst outcomes. At these colleges, sixty-four percent of student-parents with young children defaulted on their loans within 12 years of enrolling. As a result, one-quarter of all undergraduate defaulters at for-profits had children age 3 or younger.\n\nThe plight of single parents\n\nPerhaps most troubling is how many defaulted borrowers were single parents. Single parents make up two-thirds of student-parents who default, and account for 18 percent of all undergraduate defaults.\n\nHigh rates of default have important implications for these families. When students who have partners default, they are often able to lean on the credit and finances of the other parent to make ends meet as the former student resolves the default. However, for single parents, there may not be another adult who can support the family. This can keep single-parent families in dire economic circumstances for a much longer period, if they are ever able to get out.\n\nAfrican Americans and Latinos make up 60 percent of defaulted single parents\n\nUndergraduates of color are more likely to have children than their white counterparts, and the data show that they are also a larger proportion of student-parents who default. African Americans and Latinos made up 52 percent of all student-parents (and 60 percent of all single parents) who defaulted within 12 years of enrolling.\n\nThe default issue is particularly acute for single African American student-parents. Almost 90 percent of defaulted African American students with children were single. That share was 64 percent for Latino student-parents, 10 percentage points higher than for white student-parents.\n\nThese data provide further evidence that single parents, especially those of color, should be a primary group of concern. CAP recently revealed the extent to which African American borrowers struggle to repay their student loans, and the analyses presented here provide further evidence that underrepresented students experience particularly poor outcomes. To confront these problems, the Department of Education must collect data on borrowers’ race to better understand these problems and develop effective solutions.\n\nWhat can be done to help borrowers with children?\n\nParents who go to school seeking a better life for themselves and their children deserve better odds than a coin flip that they might default on their loans. The data show that the size of the loan balances of students with children are not the problem. Quite the opposite. Across all types of colleges, student-parents who defaulted had smaller balances than those who did not. This holds true for single parents as well as students who are raising children with a partner.\n\nWhy are student-parents defaulting at such high rates? It is difficult to say without additional data, but the federal government, states, and institutions can take several steps to improve the educational experiences of these students, which can help keep them complete college and improve their repayment outcomes.\n\nOn the repayment side, the federal government should examine whether student-parents are able to take advantage of plans that tie monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes. Unfortunately, the students included in these data enrolled six years* before Income-Based Repayment became available, which could partly explain these negative outcomes. However, more than 1 million borrowers default every year, raising questions as to whether students who would benefit from income-driven repayment options are using these plans. If they are not, the federal government should conduct additional research on default, and put together focus groups and other consumer testing to figure out why borrowers don’t use these plans.\n\nPolicymakers can also do more to keep undergraduates with children from having to take on debt in the first place. The federal government and states should extend public assistance programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to more adults enrolled in college to help offset the costs of student-parents. States should be more supportive of these students by guaranteeing them state grant aid and extending promise—often called free college—initiatives beyond recent high school graduates. On the institutional side, free or subsidized child care, flexible course schedules, and opportunities to earn credit by assessing students’ current knowledge and skills can help reduce student-parents’ costs and the time they spend enrolled.\n\nIf the aim of the America’s higher education system is to provide an escape from poverty and to spur the prosperity of those who have been historically marginalized, then ensuring that student-parents are able to successfully repay their debt is a must. Student-parents should be getting more from our higher education system, and policymakers have the power to improve their outcomes.\n\nColleen Campbell is the associate director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress.\n\n*Author’s note: Although IBR was authorized in 2007, borrowers could not enroll in the plan until 2009.\nleft-wing\n    https://jacobin.com/2021/12/seattle-kshama-sawant-reelection-socialism-city-council-capitalist-strategy\n2021-12-10\nIn a razor-tight race, Seattle’s socialist city council member Kshama Sawant beat off a recall attempt bankrolled by the city’s business interests. She won by just over two hundred votes in a race that went down to the wire. The outcome wasn’t determined until two days after the election, as mail-in ballots streamed in after election day. Six hundred ballots have been challenged and could still be counted, but they are not expected to change the recall’s outcome. Sawant won largely based on a concerted effort to get out the youth vote. Among all demographics, the eighteen to twenty-five cohort was the only one which increased its turnout from the most recent election, held only one month earlier. Three hundred more voters in that age group voted in this election compared to last month, and those three hundred were largely the margin of victory. To indicate the level of interest in the race: last month’s general election turnout was 43 percent. Turnout for the Sawant recall — a single-candidate special election — was 53 percent. Seattle’s capitalists have tried repeatedly to stamp out Sawant and her socialist politics from City Hall since her election in 2014. Repeatedly, they have failed. In 2013, Seattle voters elected Sawant for the first time. Since then, she has been the council’s most radical member. Though she has collaborated with fellow progressives on various legislative issues, Sawant is known for her take-no-prisoners style. She does not triangulate. She does not compromise for the sake of legislative success. She asserts her politics without fear. Though this makes her a target for conservative business interests who continually brand her as a dangerous extremist, it also earns her the passionate support of the city’s progressive voters. In celebrating the passage of a resolution taxing Amazon and other major companies in order to build low-income housing, she unabashedly confronted Jeff Bezos: We were clear-eyed about naming the real force pulling the strings: Amazon. Many argued that we should not “antagonize” big business and instead try to broker a deal, but we know that our power comes from working people getting organized, not from any negotiation with the elite. For those watching from outside Seattle, don’t let anyone tell you in your fight to tax big business in your city that you’re being divisive, because class struggle is what gets the goods. The private, for-profit housing market has utterly failed working people. Not just here and now, but everywhere and always. Because capitalism is completely incapable of meeting the most basic needs of working people. Internationally, the working class needs to take the top 500 corporations into democratic public ownership, run by workers, in the interests of human need and the environment, not billionaire greed. I have a message for Jeff Bezos and his class. If you attempt again to overturn the Amazon Tax, working people will go all out in the thousands to defeat you. And we will not stop there. Because you see, we are fighting for far more than this tax, we are preparing the ground for a different kind of society. And if you, Jeff Bezos, want to drive that process forward by lashing out against us in our modest demands, then so be it. Because we are coming for you and your rotten system. We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state. We cannot and will not stop until we overthrow it and replace it with a world based instead on solidarity, genuine democracy, and equality — a socialist world. She is an Indian immigrant who earned a degree in computer science at the University of Mumbai and began her career as a software engineer. She currently teaches economics at two local community colleges and is a leader of the Socialist Alternative. Sawant is a fiery speaker known for her speeches at local protests. She has championed several issues beloved by local progressives including demanding that local companies pay more in taxes to support housing for the homeless and education. Her local campaign for a $15 minimum wage helped build momentum for similar laws around the country. She has also championed renters’ rights and an eviction moratorium during the COVID epidemic. Sawant is unsparing and unrepentant in espousing her radical views. For that reason, she serves as a third rail in Seattle politics. Her colleagues may join with her on some issues, but they often steer clear in order to avoid the pushback the “radical socialist” receives. Landlords, real estate developers, and Big Tech routinely recruit candidates and donate large sums to unseat her. So far, they’ve failed in two previous elections. Last year, business decided to take a different tack. Since they could not defeat her in a general election, they decided to attempt a recall. They cleverly determined that scheduling the recall during a regular election would tend to increase turnout, which would not be to their advantage — from the anti-Sawant point of view, the fewer voters who showed up for the recall, the better. So they delayed registering their campaign in order to force a special election in which this single issue would be on the ballot. Anti-Sawant forces also raised over $1 million to fund TV commercials, glossy mailers and radio spots targeting her as a law-breaking extremist who would encourage mobs to attack City Hall and the homeless to take over the city stately neighborhoods. They even created a separate PAC enabling donors to give unlimited funds to support the recall. A Better Seattle raised $200,000 from its largely corporate donor base. To give a sense of how much money they spent: in the last election in which Sawant was reelected, the Chamber of Commerce PAC spent a then-unprecedented $1 million on all four of the council races (including Sawant’s). This time they spent that much just to defeat a single candidate: her. What the recall campaign had in well-heeled donors, the Sawant campaign made up for in committed small donors. And she matched her opponents virtually dollar for dollar. Despite Sawant’s victory, we should not expect the backlash threat of the corporate elite to decline. We saw this in the write-in campaign against Buffalo’s democratic socialist mayoral candidate, India Walton, which restored to office the Democratic machine mayor who’d lost the primary. Capital does not like losing, and it will retrench and return to the fray whenever left candidates like Sawant and Walton emerge. The victory over the Seattle recall takes some of the sting out of the defeat of progressive candidates for mayor and city attorney in November’s general election. It confirms that an avowedly progressive socialist message still resonates among Seattle voters. Those defeats were, in part, a backlash against last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, in which activists occupied the heart of the city’s Capitol Hill in June 2020. Two of the incidents emphasized by the recall proponents against Sawant were her participation in a march on City Hall, in which she used her key to open the building for the protesters. Separately, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter organized a march on Mayor Jenny Durkan’s home for which Sawant was blamed. Concurrent with the Capitol Hill occupation, the city’s corporate power structure was running a competing campaign portraying the city as “dying” due to crime, vandalism, and homeless encampments “invading” schools and neighborhoods. The city’s Sinclair Broadcasting affiliate, KOMO News, produced a special with the death-rattle title “Seattle Is Dying,” drawing national attention to these right-wing talking points. The TV evening news showed hundreds of stories of gang violence, shootings, and murders. They produced stories about fires, drug dealing, and murder at homeless encampments. The Seattle Times, owned for a hundred thirty years by a single wealthy Republican family, breathlessly hyped these developments on its news and editorial pages. During the year between the Capitol Hill occupation and the November election, the anti-homeless media campaign had a major impact. The city council, passed a 20 percent cut to the police department budget. But the mayoral candidate who ultimately won in the November election opposes any cut at all. By November, the enthusiasm and commitment which the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) had infused into Seattle had dissipated. That explains the electoral defeats mentioned earlier. The good news is that Sawant’s victory has arrested the momentum of the corporate elite. There will be no stampede to rid the city of its homeless population. The Left still has a strong voice in Seattle.\nleft-wing\n    https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2016/dec/medicare-debate-intensify-democrats-draw-battle-lines\n2016-12-05\nBy Kerry Young, CQ Roll Call\n\nNovember 30, 2016 -- Republicans do not yet have a united approach on whether to push to make significant changes in Medicare. But Democrats are already pouncing on the opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of seniors and people with disabilities against Republicans who want to gut the entitlement program.\n\n\"\"It's clear that Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\"\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who will lead the chamber's Democrats next year, on Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers may turn to a debate about the future of Medicare after Republicans take steps to partially repeal the 2010 health care law, which President-elect Donald Trump has set as a priority. House GOP aides are already working on legislative language for repeal.\n\nHouse Republicans have been pressing for years for a major shift in Medicare, with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., advocating for a move toward a defined contribution program. Under such a program, seniors would be given a set amount of money to shop for a Medicare plan. Critics say that if capped spending doesn't keep up with health care costs, seniors could suffer.\n\nUnder GOP proposals, insurers would play a larger role than they already do in managing Medicare. Already, private Medicare Advantage plans cover roughly one of every three people enrolled in Medicare, which serves people who are 65 and older or who have significant disabilities.\n\nBut some Senate Republicans don't appear as anxious as their House counterparts to jump into such a politically risky debate. Schumer already is predicting that GOP efforts to further privatize Medicare will falter, as did their plans for Social Security after their 2004 electoral victory.\n\nSome Medicare changes may fall outside what can easily be handled through the fast-track legislative mechanism that House Republicans are eyeing to quickly undo parts of the 2010 health care law, said Joseph Antos, a researcher with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The rules for using so-called budget reconciliation allow measures to proceed with simple majorities in the Senate and thus avoid filibusters, but the tool can only be used in limited circumstances. Rules named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., narrow the number of items to be included in a reconciliation bill to those with the clearest connection to changes in federal spending and revenue.\n\n\"\"All that is so complex and time-consuming that Medicare will have to wait, at least in terms of big decisions,\"\" Antos told CQ Roll Call. \"\"The big push will probably not be in 2017 unless there is a grand package of reforms\"\" that sweeps in Medicare and Medicaid, the joint federal–state health program for low-income people.\n\nSenate Republicans Reluctant\n\nSome Senate Republicans don't expect Congress to tackle a Medicare debate next year and say that it would not happen as part of the repeal of the 2010 health care law.\n\n\"\"My impression is that everyone would see [the health law] repeal as an issue in and of itself. It may have some Medicaid components, but I doubt that it has many Medicare components,\"\" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., told CQ Roll Call.\n\nMoran also said he's concerned that House lawmakers will eye Medicare as a source of savings to be used for other purposes. \"\"My view is that any changes in Medicare would be designed to strengthen and improve Medicare, and it should not be a source for funding other things,\"\" he said.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Tuesday he doesn't think that changes to Medicare should be part of next year's repeal effort.\n\n\"\"I think that falls under the rule of not biting off more than you can chew,\"\" the Tennessee Republican told reporters. \"\"One of the Democrats' big problems with Obamacare was they tried to do too much, too fast. I think the problems about the solvency of Medicare should be left for another debate, another discussion.\"\"\n\nSen. Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is one of a handful of Democrats who say they would oppose Trump's nomination of House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services due to his support for plans to alter Medicare.\n\n\"\"The nomination vote on Tom Price is the first test of whether Congress is prepared to stand up to the Republicans' clear desire to end Medicare as we know it,\"\" Murphy said in a statement.\n\nStill, some Senate Republicans are anxious for a broad discussion of changes to the so-called entitlement programs that rest at the heart of the nation's budget woes.\n\n\"\"The big deal that we've got to do is going to have to include Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,\"\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nFlake said he expected this work would have to wait until after completion of the effort to partially repeal the 2010 health care law.\n\n\"\"It's tough to see how it all fits in. It's a packed schedule, so I'd be surprised to see a serious discussion of Medicare in the months ahead,\"\" he said.\n\nIn contrast, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said it's possible that a broader conversation about changes to Medicare could emerge in the Obamacare repeal debate.\n\n\"\"It will be a part of the conversation,\"\" Isakson said. \"\"Everything is going to be open for grabs.\"\"\nleft-wing\n    https://www.cfr.org/article/miscalculating-tunisia\n2021-07-28\nOn July 25, Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the country’s prime minister and suspended parliament for 30 days. Security forces were then deployed around the parliament building in Tunis, blocking legislators from passing through. The next day, the president forced out the acting justice minister, sacked the defense minister, and ordered the offices of Al Jazeera closed. He also banned gatherings of three people or more. \n\nMore From Our Experts\nElliott Abrams\nIsrael's Crisis\nSteven A.

Barkey\nErdoğan Is In Danger\n\nRached Ghannouchi, the speaker of the now shuttered parliament and longtime leader of the Islamist Ennahdha party, called Saied’s action a “coup.” The president disagreed, citing Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which gives the head of state the power to do precisely what he did in the event of “imminent danger threatening the integrity of the country and the country’s security and independence.” There is a significant difference of opinion, however, as to whether Tunisia’s current dire economic problems, parliamentary drift, and a debilitating wave of COVID-19 actually amount to such imminent danger. This would seem to be a problem that the Constitutional Court could adjudicate—but alas, there is no court because either no one can agree on which judges to appoint or the president has blocked their appointment. \n\nMore on:\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nTunisia\n\nDemocracy\n\nCoup or no coup, this was not supposed to happen in Tunisia. Tunisia is (or was) the “lone success story” of the Arab Spring. But these kinds of clichés, used by international media over and over for a decade, were themselves always a problem. They framed Tunisian politics in a way that closed off other possibilities—like backsliding—and envisaged linear developments from protests to elections to a constitution. When breathless editorials described a peaceful transfer of power to a “genuine democracy,” they stripped out the complexity of Tunisian politics specifically and transitions to democracy more generally. \n\nThe World This Week\nA weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Tunisians have been on the brink before, including during an extended political stalemate in 2013. Then, in 2015, newly elected President Beji Caid Essebsi preferred a government that would have excluded Ennahdha and its allies. Unfortunately for Essebsi and the secularists of his Nidaa Tounes party, the parliamentary math did not work in his favor, forcing a broader coalition. Goodwill eventually developed between the president and Ghannouchi, but what seemed more important than personality in forcing a compromise was the very fact that neither Essebsi nor Ghannouchi had the kind of popular support necessary to impose his will on the other—an apparent benefit of a divided society.\n\nIt was laudable and notable that Tunisia did not descend into violence in 2013, that a workable coalition government was established in 2015, and that there was a peaceful transfer of power after Essebsi died in 2019––though none of these achievements necessarily meant that Tunisia was going to continue to progress. Serious analysts knew this because they understood the country’s economic challenges, the lingering questions around identity, the yen for the old order among elites, and the inability of parliament to make good on the promise of the January 2011 revolution. \n\nMore From Our Experts\nElliott Abrams\nIsrael's Crisis\nSteven A. Cook\nTwenty Years After the War to Oust Saddam, Iraq Is a Shaky Democracy\nHenri J. Barkey\nErdoğan Is In Danger\n\nYet curiously, some of these same experts and observers continued to describe Tunisia straightforwardly as a success—creating an unwritten and unacknowledged expectation that the country’s progress would invariably continue. This was especially odd, given the ongoing erosion in the past decade of democratic institutions in countries considered consolidated democracies––including the United States. \n\nIn the few days since Saied gave himself executive authority, there have been protests both in support and opposition to his actions. The former are more interesting. Dispatches from Tunisia indicate that those hailing the president have had enough of poor governance and a lack of economic opportunity. Layer into these problems the fact that a recent wave of COVID-19 has devastated the country’s health care system, and a lot more people seem willing to bet on an authoritarian who promises to make their lives better with more unencumbered power at his disposal. \n\nMore on:\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nTunisia\n\nDemocracy\n\nThe readiness to part with hard-won gains after a decade of democratization seems to be part and parcel of Tunisia’s particular political culture. No, I’m not referring to the canard that Arab and Muslim societies are unpracticed at democracy; rather, I mean to draw attention to the cultural legacy of the big Arab state that promised (but rarely, if ever, delivered) security, education, and opportunity. The analysts, journalists, and civil society activists with whom Westerners tend to interact in Tunisia want to forge a more just and democratic society. But what about Tunisians more broadly? Many—or at least the ones in the streets in the last few days—seem to have a more ambivalent relationship with democracy. They seem to want a more effective state that can deliver jobs and a social safety net regardless of the character of the political system. It is possible that after a decade in which Tunisians enjoyed greater personal freedoms, the lack of prosperity has made a potentially significant number of them more willing to give some version of authoritarianism another try. \n\nOf course, it remains entirely unclear what will happen in Tunisia and what foreign powers can do about it. Given how much attention the press and experts have lavished on Tunisia since the overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, combined with U.S. President Joe Biden’s commitment to a values-based foreign policy, there will be at least some pressure for the United States to respond. Yet here is the conundrum: In Washington, Tunisia tends to be viewed through the prism of its presumed success. Thus, experts and activists have advocated for providing more assistance to Tunisia precisely because it is alleged to have made the transition to democracy. The United States has also developed a security relationship with Tunisia based on fighting extremism. Should the United States now withhold or cut this aid? That would seem appropriate in terms of values but perhaps risky when it comes to security, given Tunisia’s penchant for producing extremists and instability in the neighboring Sahel region. This is not an easy circle to square. \n\nIn what would be one of the more unexpected developments in U.S. Middle East policy, Tunisia may end up being a cautionary tale in building a policy around a regime type because political systems can change—quickly. \nleft-wing\n    https://www.demos.org/blog/one-job-too-many-ceo-shouldnt-also-be-chairman\n2013-05-14\nWith Jamie Dimon under growing fire from shareholders of JP Morgan Chase, one possibility is that he may relinquish his role as chairman of the board but remain as CEO. That raises an interesting question: Why does Dimon hold both jobs to begin with? \n\nThe answer is that it's common practice at many corporations for the CEO to also be chair, known as \"\"duality.\"\" Surveys have found that CEOs also hold the chair position in the majority of large corporations. But why is that? After all, isn't the job of a board to supervise the CEO and organization as a whole -- or at least closely monitor things? In fact it is. So who came up with idea of having the CEO also lead the body that is supposed to be his or her boss? \n\nArguments for duality rest, in part, on the idea that it is more efficient and effective to have one person fully in charge. And anyone who has ever seen the president and the board chair of an organization end up at odds knows that there is something to this logic. \n\nBut the conflicts of interest inherent in duality would seem to militate clearly in favor of dividing these jobs. I mean, doesn't anyone remember the scandals of the Enron era, where you had imperial CEOs like Bernard Ebbers of Worldcom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco driving their companies into the ground? Don't people remember the way that CEOs packed boards -- and especially board compensation and audit committees -- with cronies that wrote them a blank check at shareholder expense? \n\nCome to think of it, forget all that ancient history. What about all the imperial bank CEOs-Chairmen, like Merrill's Stanley O'Neal, who led their firms to gorge on toxic assets without any real supervision? \n\nA key takeaway of all these scandals is that boards needed to be more independent, and the good news is that both regulatory changes and voluntarily corporate actions have reduced the pervasiveness of duality over the past decade. But this bad idea lives on, as we see at JP Morgan and many other companies. \n\nIn some countries, duality is illegal. That should be the case here. \n\nOne footnote: duality is very rare in the nonprofit sector. The president of Princeton University isn't also chair of its board of trustees. The president of Ford isn't wielding the gavel at the foundation's board meetings. Maybe there are nonprofits where the CEO and chair jobs are combined, but I don't know of any. \nleft-wing\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Sample Data"
